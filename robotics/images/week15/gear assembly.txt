# 15. Mechanical design

For 2-Axis movement, we needed the gears driving the board in the same vertical axis.  
The below image was our first sketch in making that.

But since the individual axis were open, the system was not stable.  
So for the second attempt, we connected the system at top so both would give stability to the other.  
Also, for the twisting, we added ball socket joints at the upper nodes.

We also changed the design of the base to make it more stable. This was the new design

These are the laser cut parts for this updated base.

This is how it turned out to be.

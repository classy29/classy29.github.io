        I started this week with <a>3d printing</a>. I was kinda waiting for this week XD. I was eager to know what can i do with these machines and what types of complex and very difficult to substrate shapes i can print.so,
        <h3>What is 3D printing ?</h3>


        3D printing or additive manufacturing is a process of making three dimensional solid objects from a digital file.<br><br>
        The creation of a 3D printed object is achieved using additive processes. In an additive process an object is created by laying down successive layers of material until the object is created. Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly
        sliced horizontal cross-section of the eventual object.<br><br>
        3D printing is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing which is cutting out / hollowing out a piece of metal or plastic with for instance a milling machine.
        3D printing enables you to produce complex (functional) shapes using less material than traditional manufacturing methods.
        <br><br><a href="https://3dprinting.com/what-is-3d-printing/"><b>Click Here!</b></a> for more information<br><br>

        <h3>Types of 3d printers</h3>

        <h4>1) Stereolithography (SLA)</h4>
        SLA is a fast prototyping process. Those who use this technology are serious about accuracy and precision. Machines that use this technology produce unique models, patterns, prototypes, and various production parts. They do this by converting
        liquid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopolymer"><b>photopolymers</b></a> (a special type of plastic) into solid 3D objects, one layer at a time. The plastic is first heated to turn it into a semi-liquid form, and then it hardens
        on contact. The printer constructs each of these layers using an ultra violet laser, directed by X and Y scanning mirrors. Just before each print cycle, a recoater blade moves across the surface to ensure each thin layer of resin spreads
        evenly across the object. The print cycle continues in this way, building 3D objects from the bottom up.
        <h4>2) Digital Light Processing (DLP)</h4>
        DLP is the oldest of the 3D printing technologies, created by a man called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Hornbeck"><b></b></a>Larry Hornbeck back in 1987. It’s similar to SLA (see above), given that it also works with
        photopolymers. The liquid plastic resin used by the printer goes into a translucent resin container. There is, however, one major difference between the two, which is the source of light. While SLA uses ultra violet light, DLP uses a more
        traditional light source, usually arc lamps. This process results in pretty impressive printing speeds. When there’s plenty of light, the resin is quick to harden (we’re talking seconds). Compared to SLA 3D printing, DLP achieves quicker
        print times for most parts.
        <h4>3) Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)</h4>
        FDM is a 3D printing process developed by Scott Crump, and then implemented by Stratasys Ltd., in the 1980s. It uses production grade thermal plastic materials to print its 3D objects. It’s popular for producing functional prototypes, concept
        models, and manufacturing aids. It’s a technology that can create accurate details and boasts an exceptional strength to weight ratio.
        Before the FDM printing process begins, the user has to slice the 3D CAD data (the 3D model) into multiple layers using special software. The sliced CAD data goes to the printer which then builds the object layer at a time on the build
        platform. It does this simply by heating and then extruding the thermoplastic filament through the nozzle and onto the base. The printer can also extrude various support materials as well as the thermoplastic.
        <h4>4) Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)</h4>
        It’s a 3D printing technique that uses high power CO2 lasers to fuse particles together. The laser sinters powdered metal materials (though it can utilize other materials too, like white nylon powder, ceramics and even glass). Here’s how it
        works:<br><br>
        The build platform, or bed, lowers incrementally with each successive laser scan. It’s a process that repeats one layer at a time until it reaches the object’s height. There is un-sintered support from other powders during the build process
        that surround and protect the model. This means the 3D objects don’t need other support structures during the build. Someone will remove the un-sintered powders manually after printing. SLS produces durable, high precision parts, and it can
        use a wide range of materials.
        <h4>5) Selective Laser Melting (SLM)</h4>
        SLM made its debut appearance back in 1995. It was part of a German research project at the Fraunhofer Institute ILT, located in the country’s most western city of Aachen. Like SLA (see above), SLM also uses a high-powered laser beam to form
        3D parts. During the printing process, the laser beam melts and fuses various metallic powders together.
        <h4>6) Electron Beam Melting (EBM)</h4>
        A Swedish company called Arcam AB founded EBM® in 1997. This is a 3D printing technology similar to SLM (see above), in that it uses a powder bed fusion technique. The difference between the two is the power source. The SLM approach above
        uses high-powered laser in a chamber of noble, or inert gas. EBM, on the other hand, uses a powerful electron beam in a vacuum.
        <h4>7) Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM)</h4>
        LOM is a rapid prototyping system that works by fusing or laminating layers of plastic or paper using both heat and pressure. A computer-controlled blade or laser cuts the object to the desired shape. Once each printed layer is complete, the
        platform moves down by about 1/16th of an inch, ready for the next layer.


        <h3 id="3dprinting"></h3><br><br><br><br>
        <h3>3D Printing work</h3>
        For 3d Printing i need to have some 3d model which is difficult to build by substractive manufacturing process in other words it can't be made by just removing the material.<br><br>
        So i choose <a><b>Rhino(version 6) with Grasshopper</b></a>. i found this combination very helpful to generate creative shapes.<br><br>
        <h4>lets start ,</h4>
        <div>
          <p class="step">STEP 1 : Open Grasshopper in rhino</p>
          <img src="images/week6/3dprinting/1.png" alt="">
          <p></p>

          <p class="step">STEP 2 : Active Point tool</p>
          <img src="images/week6/3dprinting/2.png" alt="">
          <p>you can active commands by writing the command name on command line.</p>

          <p class="step">STEP 3 : Active voronoi comand in Grasshopper</p>
          <img src="images/week6/3dprinting/3.png" alt="">
          <p>Double click and type <a><b>Voronoi</b></a>. Voronoi is command which will help us to generate different patterns on surface.<br><br>
            It works on beautiful mathematical concept in which set of local points have their effective area. this areas are represents points minimum distance compare to other points. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram"><b>click
                here</b></a> to know more.</p>

          <p class="step">STEP 4 : Open point mod</p>
          <img src="images/week6/3dprinting/4.png" alt="">
          <p>>> Right click on point mode<br><br>
            >> Select multiple point option<br><br>
            >> Select points which are generated on rhino
          </p>

          <p class="step">STEP 5 : Add Box 2pt tool</p>
          <img src="images/week6/3dprinting/5.jpg" alt="">
          <p>By adding <a><b>BOX 2Pt tool</b></a> you can insert point(non physical point - you cant select it with mouse). it wil help to give boundry to the voronoi pattern.</p>

          <p class="step">STEP 6 : Extrude the Box</p>
          <img src="images/week6/3dprinting/6.jpg" alt="">
          <img src="images/week6/3dprinting/6a.png" alt="">
          <p>extrude the box by extrude command in grasshopper. <br><br>Add <a><b>Unit z</b></a> mod and connect it with <a><b>Direction</b></a> point of extrude<br><br>You have to add <a><b>number slider</b></a> to Unit Z.</p>

          <p class="step">STEP 7 : Define boundary of Voronoi pattern</p>
          <img src="images/week6/3dprinting/7.png" alt="">
          <p>Connect box output with boundy junction of Voronoi mod<br><br>you can see voronoi diagram has one boundary now.</p>

          <p class="step">STEP 8 : OFFSET TOOL</p>
          <img src="images/week6/3dprinting/8.png" alt="">
          <p><b><a>OFFSET TOOL</a></b> will help us to generate pattern.<br><br>see below</p>

          <p class="step">STEP 9 : Connect offset with voronoi</p>
          <img src="images/week6/3dprinting/9.jpg" alt="">
          <p>By connecting voronoi with the offset, you can see in image, it will generate paths in area.</p>

          <p class="step">STEP 10 : Parametric relations</p>
          <img src="images/week6/3dprinting/10.gif" alt="">
          <p>By using the <a><b>Number slider</b></a> tool, i can change offset factor in real time.</p>
          <img src="images/week6/3dprinting/11.gif" alt="">
          <p>you can manipulate the voronoi diagram by just changing points location.</p>
          <img src="images/week6/3dprinting/12.gif" alt="">
          <p>you can move and rotate(with respect to reference point) multiple points and select pattern whichever you like</p>

          <p class="step">STEP 11 : Add extrude comand</p>
          <img src="images/week6/3dprinting/12.png" alt="">
          <p>Add extrude comand to the output of offset.<br><br></p>
          <img src="images/week6/3dprinting/12a.gif" alt="">
          <p><a><b>IMPORTANT !</b></a></p>
          <img src="images/week6/3dprinting/12c.png" alt="">
          <p>These are the intersections of offset, for better pattern it should be eliminated. </p>
          <img src="images/week6/3dprinting/12a.jpg" alt="">
          <p>You have to go to <a><b>expression</b></a> tab of Offset mod to give the variable "-x". it will remove the intersection between the offsets and make them close.</p>

          <P class="step">STEP 12 :</P>
          <img src="images/week6/3dprinting/12abc.png" alt="">
          <p>Right click to extrude and select <a><b>flatten</b></a><br><br>you can see dotted wire cpmming in input. it shows multiple data input(<a>Brep</a>) . we have to convert it into single information. thats why we use flatten.</p>
          <img src="images/week6/3dprinting/12ab.png" alt="">
          <p>type <a><b>cap holes</b></a> in grasshopper which creates solids of enclosed regions.</p>
          <img src="images/week6/3dprinting/13.png" alt="">
          <p>then connect <a><b>cap holes</b></a> with <a><b>Solid difference</b></a> mod in B point, and then <a><b>Extrude</b></a> mod from <a><b>step 11</b></a> to A points.<br><br>

            A = solid which is going tp subtract<br><br>
            B = solid witch will be use to subtract

            <p class="step">STEP 13 : generate a rendom surface</p>
            <img src="images/week6/3dprinting/13.gif" alt="">
            <p>Make a curve on <a><b>Rhino</b></a> with <a><b>curve</b></a> command.</p>
            and extrude it with <a><b>extrudecrv</b></a> command.


            <p class="step">STEP 14 : Surface morph</p>
            <img src="images/week6/3dprinting/14.jpg" alt="">

<code>

<a><b>Material : PLA</b></a>

<a><b>Scale-down</b></a> the model to 50 %
tried different <a><b>Orientation</b></a>

<a><b>Profile</b></a> : Determines Quality
Normal = 0.15 mm

<a><b>Quality</b></a> :
Layer height : 0.2mm : more layer hieght less 3d print time and less quality

<a><b>Infill</b></a> :
Infill density : 10% : Infill stands for cavity area inside the walls
Lower the infill lower the printing time weaker the job

<a><b>Speed</b></a> :
outer wall speed : 60 mm/s : Print speed of outer walls
Inner wall speed : 60 mm/s : print speed of inner walls
TOp-bottom speed : 50 mm/s : Top-bottom wall speed
support speed : 55 mm/s
Travel speed : 200 mm/s

Higher the speed lower the time and bed printing quality

Enabled Acceleration. : It will accelerate the nozzle while travelling , reduces the time and effects retraction

<a><b>Retraction</b></a> : Retraction is ability of nozzle to retract or suck the material in when printing is not
needed.

Enabled Jerk control : Controls the jerk

<a><b>Support</b></a> :
Support placement : Everywhere : Supports overhangs
Support pattern : Grid : Depends on printing model
Support density : 12 : how much area it will cover

<a><b>Build plate adhesion</b></a> :
Build plate adhesion : Raft : for giving support at Build plat, to make the model attached to Build plate

        <h3>Flashforge</h3>
        <p>i was also printing my model with flashforge, so i can have design limitation of both the printers, in flashforge i can go upto overhangs of <a><b>70 degrees</b></a>. i came to this conclusion by doing some limitation test on the flashforge as part of our <a><b>group work</b></a>. below are some pictures of overhang limitation test it prints fine upto 70 degree and i think it can go straight to 80-85 degree</p>
        <img src="images/week6/3dprinting/25a.jpg">
        <img src="images/week6/3dprinting/25c.jpg">

        <p>But i didn't want to make so easy for flashforge to print my model, so i decided to print model without supports. I took one sample of my design and tried different <a>Orientation</a>, <a>Speed</a>, <a>Temperature</a> to make perfect
          G-codes for design. i was using <a href="http://www.flashforge.com/flashprint/"><b>flashprint</b></a> softwere for generating <a><b>.gx</b></a> file.</p>

        <p>i was quite sure most of overhang will work fine, but <a><b>Want</b></a> to know which part remains week comparatively, so i can give manual supports there.</p>

        <p>Results are really <a><b>good</b></a> and i was sure i can print this model in this orientation without supports, only <a><b>Critic</b></a> side is that end overhang which can be managed on post processing.</p>

        <p>i tried with different orientation this time, time was <a><b>30 minutes</b></a> less, but there was a problem , <a><b>Raft</b></a> was not sticking to print bed, so increased the bed temperature( up to <a><b>60 degree</b></a>) and nozzle
          temperature( up to<a><b> 210 degree</b></a>) also.</p>
          <p class="step"> Very strong Raft</p>
          <p>one thing i dont like in print is very <a><b>strong raft</b></a>. yes ! raft or brim is necessary in support of model, but this was a headache, it bonds so strong with my model that it tear of my very first layer of it, to resolve it i
            opened expert mode in <a>preference</a> and change Z offset to 0.4 mm . Hope it help.</p>
        <p class="step"> STEP 27 : Output</p>
        <p> I think increasing temperature was mistake. Due to that i found retraction problems on output material was not solidifying as quickly as it should be. in bridge side material got separated little bit, it supposed to be clean as per
          overhang test (<a>Reason can be <a><b>Low print area</b></a> and <a><b>Temperature factor</b></a>. i have to try second time with low speed and suggested temperature. this orientation reduces 39 minutes of my sample , so it will definitely
            banefit me in full model</p>

          <p>
            none of above parameteer help me here. i had same retraction issues there, so i went for the first orientation.

    <h3>scanning</h3>
    <h4>what is 3D scanning ?</h4>
    3D Laser Scanning is a non-contact, non-destructive technology that digitally captures the shape of physical objects using a line of laser light. 3D laser scanners create “point clouds” of data from the surface of an object. In other words, 3D
    laser scanning is a way to capture a physical object’s exact size and shape into the computer world as a digital 3-dimensional representation.

    <h3>Types of 3d scanning</h3>
    <h4>Photogrammetry</h4>
    Stemming from photography, photogrammetry is an incredibly useful technology in various fields. The technology takes multiple images, taken at different positions, and triangulates points in these images to figure out the location of them in a
    three-dimensional space. For example, land surveyors utilize this technology when making maps. When dealing with inaccessible places, such as mountains, the surveyors are able to use photogrammetry to perform their measurements. Many modern
    technologies use photogrammetry, the major determiner in precision relies on the caliber of the images. If images are poor, there will be holes in the mesh. The more images that you can produce, the greater the accuracy of your scan will be.

    <h4>Structured Light</h4>
    The technology here is created by casting geometric patterns onto an object while simultaneously taking images with a camera. When doing so, the camera logs the deviation of the image. Based on this displacement of the pattern, locations of all
    existing points are able to be determined. Numerous scans have to be conducted from different positions and then combined until the mesh can be 100% complete. Computer programs automatically combine all of the scans to form this complete mesh.
    The results formed using structured light 3D scanners are extremely precise, and the technology is available in both portable and stationary scanners.

    <h4>Time of Flight (TOF)</h4>
    Slightly more scientifically oriented are Time of Flight (TOF) 3D scanners. These scanners measure how long it takes for a laser or infrared beam to be reflected back to the scanner, with the main component in the scanner being speed of light.
    Although the scanners contain highly accurate sensors, the precision of these devices is relatively low, ranging in centimeters. This is primarily a result of how the speed of light is affected by various factors, such as temperature and
    humidity. Hence the technology is primarily used in measuring large items like buildings. The technology requires multiple scans to be conducted in order to form a complete mesh, just as with other 3D scanning technologies. The majority of
    devices using Time of Flight can be found in portable scanners.

    <h4>Laser Scanning (Triangulation)</h4>
    Perhaps the most accurate 3D scanning technology is that of laser scanning, also known to as triangulation. Similar to structured light and photogrammetry scanners, laser scanning uses the same base principle of geometry to find a point’s
    location in space. By casting a laser beam upon the object being scanned, a camera is able to record where the beam and object intersect. Knowing both the angles of the laser beam and camera makes it possible to know the precise location of the
    laser dot that is hitting the object. The accuracy of laser scanners is exceptional, ranging in mere micrometers. The only downside to the scanners is the fact that they can only range in just a few meters and the technology is typically not
    found in portable scanning devices.

    <h4>Contact</h4>
    With a self-describing name, contact printers physically touch a resting object. The scanning process can be fairly timing, and the process is very sensitive to movements and vibrations during scanning. Contact scanners are primarily used in
    quality control due to the potential alterations that they cause to objects being scanned. The technology is not used in conservation of objects as a result of this.

<h3>About original files</h3>
<p>
  Unfortunetly we had some misunderstanding about the <a><b>Skanet softwere</b></a> that we cant download original files from the softwere, so we though we cant get original files from skanect, but it was Half truth , we could just export it in stl format after necessesary editing if needed.

  The assignment was to test the design rules for our 3d Printer. The printer that the lab owns is an Ultimaker 2+. There are different kinds of test that are done to check the ability of the printer before it fails. Each on of us took up different tests and I was assigned the <a><b>overhang test</b></a>. i test angles to 20 degree to 70 degrees on flashforge and found out < it is reallygood in maters of overhang , you can see above in my design i went upto the <a><b>85 90 degree</b></a> without any supports and i can go straight to 0 or 180 degree for <a><b>average</b></a> 15 cm distance. <a><b>These are my observations</b></a>. below are some images of overhang and other test which described on website.<br /><br /> <a href="http://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/cept/3dscanningprinting.html" target="_blank" ><b>click here</b></a> to visit group website.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  This week was very exciting and one of my favourite week, i always wanted to work with 3d printer and 3d scanning was kind of bonus. thought i took some big steps in excitement i wanted to make something that is not so common is making or some patterns that can check how far 3d printer goes, i start by Voronoi designs and then realized it was too much (For ultimaker specially) , i learn to 3d print in parts or have some test print first, it helps to Decide settings for 3d printing and by that we can have different experience of parameters. 3d scanning was also very cool , it is cutting of technology we can also make something by only scanning it is some futuristic idea.

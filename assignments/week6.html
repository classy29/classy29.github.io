        <h1>3D printing</h1>
        <p>
          3D printing or additive manufacturing is a process of making three dimensional solid objects from CAD files (<a><b>STL, obj</b></a>).<br><br>

          3D printing is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing which is cutting out / hollowing out a piece of metal or plastic with for instance a milling machine. 3D printing enables you to produce complex (functional) shapes consuming less
          material than traditional manufacturing methods.<br><br>

          3D printing is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing which is cutting out / hollowing out a piece of metal or plastic with for instance a milling machine.
          3D printing enables you to produce complex (functional) shapes using less material than traditional manufacturing methods.
          <br><br><a href="https://3dprinting.com/what-is-3d-printing/" target="_blank"><b>Click Here!</b></a> for more information.
        </p>
        <h1>Types of 3d printers</h1>

        <p class="step">1) Stereolithography (SLA)</p>
        <p>
          <a><b>SLA</b></a> is a fast prototyping process. Those who use this technology are serious about accuracy and precision. Machines that use this technology produce unique models, patterns, prototypes, and various production parts.

          <br /><br /> They do this by converting
          liquid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopolymer"><b>photopolymers</b></a> (a special type of plastic) into solid 3D objects, one layer at a time. The plastic is first heated to turn it into a semi-liquid form, and then it hardens
          on contact. <a><b>The printer constructs each of these layers using an ultraviolet laser, directed by X and Y scanning mirrors</b></a>. Just before each print cycle, a recoater blade moves across the surface to ensure each thin layer of
          resin spreads
          evenly across the object. The print cycle continues in this way, building 3D objects from the bottom up.
        </p>

        <p class="step">2) Digital Light Processing (DLP)</p>
        <p>
          <a><b>DLP</b></a> is the oldest of the 3D printing technologies, created by a man called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Hornbeck" target="_blank"><b>Larry Hornbeck</b></a> back in 1987. <br /><br />It’s similar to SLA, given
          that it also works with
          photopolymers. The liquid plastic resin used by the printer goes into a translucent resin container. There is, however, <a><b>one major difference</b></a> between the two, which is the source of light. <a><b>While SLA uses ultraviolet
              light, DLP uses a more
              traditional light source, usually arc lamps</b></a>. This process results in pretty impressive printing speeds. When there’s plenty of light, the resin is quick to harden (we’re talking seconds). Compared to SLA 3D printing, DLP
          achieves quicker
          print times for most parts.
        </p>
        <p class="step">3) Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)</p>
        <p>
          <a><b>FDM</b></a> is a 3D printing process developed by <a><b>Scott Crump</b></a> and then implemented by <a><b>Stratasys Ltd, in the 1980s</b></a>.
          <br /><br />
          It uses production-grade <a><b>thermal plastic materials</b></a> to print its 3D objects. It’s popular for producing functional prototypes, concept
          models, and manufacturing aids. It’s a technology that can create accurate details and boasts an exceptional strength to weight ratio.

          <br /><br />
          Before the FDM printing process begins, the user has to slice the 3D CAD data (the 3D model) into multiple layers using special software. The sliced CAD data goes to the printer which then builds the object layer at a time on the build
          platform. It does this simply by heating and then extruding the <a><b>thermoplastic filament</b></a> through the nozzle and onto the base. The printer can also extrude various support materials as well as the thermoplastic.
        </p>
        <p class="step">4) Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)</p>
        <p>
          It’s a 3D printing technique that uses high power CO2 lasers to fuse particles. The laser sinters powdered metal materials (though it can utilize other materials too, like white nylon powder, ceramics, and even glass). Here’s how it works:

          <br><br>
          The build platform, or bed, lowers incrementally with each successive laser scan. It’s a process that repeats one layer at a time until it reaches the object’s height. There is un-sintered support from other powders during the build process
          that surrounds and protects the model. This means the 3D objects don’t need other support structures during the build. Someone will remove the un-sintered powders manually after printing. SLS produces durable, high precision parts, and it
          can use a wide range of materials.
        </p>
        <p class="step">5) Selective Laser Melting (SLM)</p>
        <p>
          <a><b>SLM</b></a> made its debut appearance back in 1995.<br /><br />

          It was part of a German research project at <a><b>the Fraunhofer Institute ILT</b></a>, located in the country’s most western city of Aachen. Like SLA (see above), SLM also uses a high-powered laser beam to form 3D parts. During the
          printing process, the laser beam melts and fuses various metallic powders.
        </p>
        <p class="step">6) Electron Beam Melting (EBM)</p>
        <p>
          A Swedish company called <a><b>Arcam AB</b></a> founded EBM® in 1997.

          <br /><br />This is a 3D printing technology similar to SLM (see above), in that it uses a powder bed fusion technique. The difference between the two is the power source. <a><b>The SLM approach above
              uses a high-powered laser in a chamber of noble, or inert gas. EBM, on the other hand, uses a powerful electron beam in a vacuum.</b></a>
        </p>
        <p class="step">7) Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM)</p>
        <p>
          LOM is a rapid prototyping system that works by fusing or laminating layers of plastic or paper using both heat and pressure. A computer-controlled blade or laser cuts the object to the desired shape. Once each printed layer is complete,
          the
          platform moves down by about 1/16th of an inch, ready for the next layer.
        </p>

        <p>
          For 3d Printing, I need to have some 3d model which is difficult to build by the subtractive manufacturing process in other words it can't be made by just removing the material.

          <br><br>
          I choose <a><b>Rhino(version 6) with Grasshopper</b></a>. I found this software very helpful to generate creative shapes.

            consideration, in the second model I found two layers are not printed well because of overhangs, but still model has Good strength and flexible also!<br /><br />

            <a>This design is not complete yet, I am going to do some iterations, for now, experiment with design and come with Final OUTPUT in Ultimaker. since I found the printer also needs some maintenance I moved to our second printer flash
              forge.</a>

          <h1>Flashforge</h1>
          <p>I was also printing my model with flash forge, so I can have design limitation of both the printers, in the flash forge I can go up to overhangs of <a><b>70 degrees</b></a>. I came to this conclusion by doing some limitation tests on the
            flash forge as part of our <a><b>group work</b></a>. below are some pictures of the overhang limitation test it prints fine up to 70 degrees and I think it can go straight to <a><b>80-85 degrees</b></a>.
            <br /><br />
            But I didn't want to make it so easy for the flash forge to print my model, so I decided to print the model without supports. I took one sample of my design and tried different Orientation, Speed, Temperature to make perfect G-codes for
            design. I was using <a href="https://www.flashforge.com/" target="_blank"><b>flash print</b></a> software for generating <a><b>.gx</b></a> file.

          <img src="images/week6/3dprinting/28c.jpg" alt="">

          <p class="step">Different orientation</p>
          <p>I tried with different orientation this time, time was <a><b>30 minutes</b></a> less, but there was a problem, <a><b>Raft</b></a> was not sticking to the print bed, so increased the bed temperature( up to <a><b>60 degrees</b></a>) and
            nozzle temperature( up to <a><b>210 degrees</b></a>) also.</p>

          <p class="step"> Very strong Raft</p>
          <p>One thing I don't like in print is a <a><b>very strong raft</b></a>. yes! raft or brim is necessary for the support of the model, but this was a headache, it bonds so strong with my model that it tears of my very first layer of it, to
            resolve it I opened expert mode in preference and change Z offset to 0.4 mm. Hope it help.</p>

          <p class="step"> STEP 27 : Output</p>
          <p>I think the increasing temperature was a mistake. Due to that, I found retraction problems on output material was not solidifying as quickly as it should be. in bridge side material got separated a little bit, it is supposed to be clean
            as per the overhang test (Reason can be <a><b>Low print area</b></a> and <a><b>Temperature factor</b></a>. I have to try a second time with low speed and suggested temperature. this orientation reduces 39 minutes of my sample, so it will
            definitely benefit me in the full model<br /><br />

            none of the above parameters help me here. I had the same retraction issues there, so I went for the first orientation.</p>

        <h1>3D scanning</h1>
        <p>
          <a><b>3D Laser Scanning</b></a> is a non-contact, non-destructive technology that digitally captures the shape of physical objects using a line of laser light. 3D laser scanners create “point clouds” of data from the surface of an object.
          In other words,
          3D
          laser scanning is a way to capture a physical object’s exact size and shape into the computer world as a digital 3-dimensional representation.
        </p>
        <h1>Types of 3d scanning</h1>
        <p class="step">Photogrammetry</p>
        <p>
          Stemming from photography, photogrammetry is an incredibly useful technology in various fields. The technology takes multiple images, taken at different positions, and triangulates points in these images to figure out the location of them
          in
          a
          three-dimensional space. For example, land surveyors utilize this technology when making maps. When dealing with inaccessible places, such as mountains, the surveyors are able to use photogrammetry to perform their measurements. Many modern
          technologies use photogrammetry, the major determiner in precision relies on the caliber of the images. If images are poor, there will be holes in the mesh. The more images that you can produce, the greater the accuracy of your scan will
          be.
        </p>

        <p class="step">Structured Light</p>
        <p>
          The technology here is created by casting geometric patterns onto an object while simultaneously taking images with a camera. When doing so, the camera logs the deviation of the image. Based on this displacement of the pattern, locations of
          all
          existing points are able to be determined. Numerous scans have to be conducted from different positions and then combined until the mesh can be 100% complete. Computer programs automatically combine all of the scans to form this complete
          mesh.
          The results formed using structured light 3D scanners are extremely precise, and the technology is available in both portable and stationary scanners.

        </p>
        <p class="step">Time of Flight (TOF)</p>
        <p>
          Slightly more scientifically oriented are Time of Flight (TOF) 3D scanners. These scanners measure how long it takes for a laser or infrared beam to be reflected back to the scanner, with the main component in the scanner being the speed of
          light.
          Although the scanners contain highly accurate sensors, the precision of these devices is relatively low, ranging in centimeters. This is primarily a result of how the speed of light is affected by various factors, such as temperature and
          humidity. Hence the technology is primarily used in measuring large items like buildings. The technology requires multiple scans to be conducted in order to form a complete mess, just as with other 3D scanning technologies. The majority of
          devices using Time of Flight can be found in portable scanners.
        </p>
        <p class="step">Laser Scanning (Triangulation)</p>
        <p>
          Perhaps the most accurate 3D scanning technology is that of laser scanning, also known to as triangulation. Similar to structured light and photogrammetry scanners, laser scanning uses the same base principle of geometry to find a point’s
          location in space. By casting a laser beam upon the object being scanned, a camera is able to record where the beam and object intersect. Knowing both the angles of the laser beam and camera makes it possible to know the precise location of
          the
          laser dot that is hitting the object. The accuracy of laser scanners is exceptional, ranging in mere micrometers. The only downside to the scanners is the fact that they can only range in just a few meters and the technology is typically
          not found in portable scanning devices.
        </p>

        <p class="step">Contact</p>
        <p>
          With a self-describing name, contact printers physically touch a resting object. The scanning process can be fairly timing, and the process is very sensitive to movements and vibrations during scanning. Contact scanners are primarily used
          in quality control due to the potential alterations that they cause to objects being scanned. The technology is not used in the conservation of objects as a result of this.

          <h1>About original files</h1>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, we had some misunderstanding about the <a><b>Skynet software</b></a> that we cant download original files from the software, so we thought we cant get original files from select, but it was Half-truth, we could just export it in STL format after necessary editing if needed. So I have to <a><b>Rescan Maharshi</b></a> and exported <a><b>Stl file</b></a>. one can download files from the slide bar.
          </p>
        <h1>Group work</h1>
        <p>
          The assignment was to test the design rules for our 3d Printer. The printer that the lab owns is an Ultimaker 2+. There are different kinds of tests that are done to check the ability of the printer before it fails. Each one of us took up different tests and I was assigned the <a><b>overhang test</b></a>. I test angles to 20 degrees to 70 degrees on the flash forge and found out it is really good in maters of overhang, you can see above in my design I went up to the <a><b>85 90 degrees</b></a> without any supports and I can go straight to 0 or 180 degrees for <a><b>average</b></a> 15 cm distance. <a><b>These are my observations</b></a>. below are some images of overhang and another test described on the website.<br /><br /> <a href="http://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/cept/3dscanningprinting" target="_blank"><b>click here</b></a> to visit group website.</p>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>
          This week was very exciting and one of my favorite weeks, I always wanted to work with 3d scanning was a kind of bonus. thought I took some big steps in excitement I wanted to make something that is not so common is making or
          some patterns that can check how far 3d printer goes, I start by Voronoi designs and then realized it was too much (For Ultimaker especially) , I learn to 3d print in parts or have some test print first, it helps to Decide settings for 3d
          printing and by that, we can have a different experience of parameters. 3d scanning was also very cool, it is cutting of technology we can also make something by only scanning it is some futuristic idea.

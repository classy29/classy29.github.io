          this week we are going to learn about microcontrollers and embedded programming , our assignment was to understand the microcontroller by reading its <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/embedded_programming/doc8183.pdf"
            target="_blank"><b>Datasheet</b></a>, to know different terms in micro controller and use them effectively in future to make own board in future as well. i want to start with very bottom , since i had some imformation about
          <a><b>Electrical
              components</b></a> in <a target="_blank" href="http://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-prakashbhaipatel/assignments/week5.html#electronic"> <b>week 5</b></a>. i started with the terms like integrated circuits and
          microcontroller.
        </p>
        <h3>Integrated circuit</h3>
        <p>


          An integrated circuit (IC), sometimes called a chip or microchip, is a semiconductor wafer on which thousands or millions of tiny resistors, capacitors, and transistors are fabricated. An IC can function as an amplifier, oscillator, timer,
          counter, computer memory, or microprocessor. A particular IC is categorized as either linear (analog) or digital, depending on its intended application.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          There are two types of IC. <a><b>Linear IC</b></a> and <a><b>Digital IC</b></a>.<br /><br />
          <a><b>Linear IC</b></a><br /><br />

          Linear ICs have continuously variable output (theoretically capable of attaining an infinite number of states) that depends on the input signal level. As the term implies, the output signal level is a linear function of the input signal
          level. Ideally, when the instantaneous output is graphed against the instantaneous input, the plot appears as a straight line. Linear ICs are used as audio-frequency (AF) and radio-frequency (RF) amplifiers. The operational amplifier(op
          amp)
          is a common device in these applications.
        </p><br />
        <a><b>Digital IC</b></a><br /><br />

        Digital ICs operate at only a few defined levels or states, rather than over a continuous range of signal amplitudes. These devices are used in computers, computer networks, modems, and frequency counters. The fundamental building blocks of
        digital ICs are logic gates, which work with binary data, that is, signals that have only two different states, called low (logic 0) and high (logic 1).
        </p>
        <h3>What is microcontroller ?</h3>
        <p>
          It’s like a small computer on a single IC. It contains a processor core, ROM, RAM and I/O pins dedicated to perform various tasks. Microcontrollers are generally used in projects and applications that require direct control of user. As it
          has
          all the components needed in its single chip, it does not need any external circuits to do its task so microcontrollers are heavily used in embedded systems and major microcontroller manufacturing companies are making them to be used in
          embedded market. A microcontroller can be called the heart of embedded system. Some examples of popular microcontrollers are 8051, AVR, PIC series of microcontrollers.
        </p>
        <img src="images/week9/7.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          Above is architecture of 8051 microcontroller. And you can see all the required components for a small project is present in a single chip.
        </p>

        <h4>Wiki definition </h4>
        <p>
          A Microcontroller (MCU for microcontroller unit, or UC for μ-controller) is a small computer on a single integrated circuit. In modern terminology, it is similar to, but less sophisticated than, a system on a chip (SoC); an SoC may include
          a
          microcontroller as one of its components. A microcontroller contains one or more CPUs (processor cores) along with memory and programmable input/output peripherals. Program memory in the form of ferroelectric RAM, NOR flash or OTP ROM is
          also
          often included on chip, as well as a small amount of RAM. Microcontrollers are designed for embedded applications, in contrast to the microprocessors used in personal computers or other general purpose applications consisting of various
          discrete chips.
          <br /> <br />
          <h4>Memory types</h4><br />
          <a><b>Ram</b></a><br /><br />
          Random Access Memory (RAM) is a term commonly used to describe the memory within a computer. Unlike ROM, RAM is a volatile memory and requires power; if power is lost, all data is also lost.
        </p><br />
        <a><b>Flash nor</b></a><br /><br />
        Flash memory is an electronic (solid-state) non-volatile computer storage medium that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed.
        </p><br />
        <a><b>OTP (One time programmable) ROM</b></a><br /><br />
        A programmable read-only memory (PROM) is a form of digital memory where the setting of each bit is locked by a fuse or antifuse. It is one type of ROM (read-only memory). The data in them is permanent and cannot be changed. PROMs are used in
        digital electronic devices to store permanent data, usually low level programs such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware"><b>firmware</b></a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcode"><b>microcode</b></a>.
        <br /><br />
        The key difference from a standard ROM is that the data is written into a ROM during manufacture, while with a PROM the data is programmed into them after manufacture.
        </p><br />
        <h4>Difference between Integrated Circuit and microcontroller</h4>
        <p>
          Microcontroller is a register based clock driven integrated circuit that read data from input, performs actions based on the instruction written in the memory and display the results at o/p.
          the biggest difference between microcontroller and normal IC is that it can be programmed through software instructions to perform different tasks.
          while an IC for e.g, IC for not gate performs just one function (of inverting the signal) and needs to be assembled on a bread board or PCB board everytime it is being used. It doesn't have any memory elements.
        </p><br />
        <h3>What is In Microprocessor ?</h3>
        <p>
          The Microprocessor is one type of simple electronic or computer devices which stores and process the data, not a desktop or computer hardware include one or few Integrated Circuits. It is similar to microcontroller, but does not have any
          peripheral devices like RAM, ROM, etc. The task of microprocessors is dependent on exterior circuits of peripherals. But there are not work for the specific task, but they are needed where the task is tough and complicated like games,
          software development, other applications that require high memory and also where I/O are not mentioned. The Microprocessor is called the heart of a computer system. For example, of the best Microprocessor are I3, Pentium, and I5 etc..

            <a>Bus (Computing)</a><br /><br />
            In computer architecture, a bus (a contraction of the Latin omnibus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers. This expression covers all related hardware components (wire,
            optical fiber, etc.) and software, including communication protocols. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)#cite_note-1" target="_blank">Wiki</a><br /><br />
            Microprocessor is processing device of every computing device. It is like an artificial brain. It needs to communicate with outer world. for example, It needs to communicate with Input devices to get data,it needs to communicate with
            memory
            to process data according to instructions written in memory and finally it needs to communicate with output devices to display the output on O/P devices. To communicate with external world, Microprocessor make use of buses. There are
            different types of buses used in Microprocessor<br /><br />

            <a>Data bus</a><br /><br />
            As name tells that it is used to transfer data within Microprocessor and Memory/Input or Output devices. It is bidirectional as Microprocessor requires to send or receive data. The data bus also works as address bus when multiplexed with
            lower order address bus. Data bus is 8 Bits long. The word length of a processor depends on data bus, thats why Intel 8085 is called 8 bit Microprocessor because it have an 8 bit data bus.<br /><br />

            <a>Control Bus</a><br /><br />
            Microprocessor uses control bus to process data, that is what to do
            with the selected memory location. Some control signals are Read, Write and Opcode fetch etc. Various operations are performed by microprocessor with the help of control bus. This is a dedicated bus, because all timing signals are
            generated
            according to control signal.<br /><br />

        <a>ALU (Arithmetic logic unit)</a><br /><br />
        An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a combinational digital electronic circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers. This is in contrast to a <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_unit"><b>floating-point unit (FPU)</b></a>, which operates on floating point numbers. An ALU is a fundamental building block of many types of computing circuits, including the central
        processing unit (CPU) of computers, FPUs, and graphics processing units (GPUs). A single CPU, FPU or GPU may contain multiple ALUs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit" target="_blank">Wiki</a>

              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer"><b>complex instruction set computer (CISC)</b></a>. Various suggestions have been made regarding a precise definition of RISC, but the general concept is that such a
            computer has a small set of simple and general instructions, rather than a large set of complex and specialized instructions. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">Wiki</a>.

              <a>In system re-programmable memory (Flash and EEROM)</a><br /><br />
              The ATtiny24A/44A/84A contains 2K/4K/8K byte On-chip In-System Reprogrammable Flash
              memory for program storage.The Flash memory has an endurance of at least 10,000 write/erase cycles.<br /><br /><a>It means one can program the isp for 10,000 time approximately. after that micro controller will not to be sure to
                prorammed. As i explained in beginning flash memory no - volatile memory and it is the type of EEROM (electrically erasable read only memory) which has large storage space in comparison to EEROM. Though EERom has advantage in
                programmable cycles , one can program <a><b>1,000,000 (cycles)</b></a> times in EEROM type memory</a><br /><br /> flash memory differs in a way that <a>EEROM has only one transistor per bit.</a> but <a>flash</a> has 8 transistors per
              bit so it is much faster in writing large data over A<a>EEROM</a> and used for store the firmware code and EEROM is used to track historuy and parameters.
            </p><br />
            <p>
              <a>Static rendom Access memory</a><br /><br />
              Static random-access memory (static RAM or SRAM) is a type of semiconductor memory that uses bistable latching circuitry (flip-flop) to store each bit. SRAM exhibits data remanence, but it is still volatile in the conventional sense
              that
              data is eventually lost when the memory is not powered.

              The term static differentiates SRAM from DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) which must be periodically refreshed. SRAM is faster and more expensive than DRAM; it is typically used for CPU cache while DRAM is used for a computer's main

              Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) is a type of random access semiconductor memory that stores each bit of data in a separate tiny capacitor within an integrated circuit. The capacitor can either be charged or discharged; these two
              states are taken to represent the two values of a bit, conventionally called 0 and 1. <br /><br />
              <a>The electric charge on the capacitors slowly leaks off, so without intervention the data on the chip would soon be lost. To prevent this, DRAM requires an external memory refresh circuit which periodically rewrites the data in the
                capacitors, restoring them to their original charge.<br /><br /> This refresh process is the defining characteristic of dynamic random-access memory, in contrast to static random-access memory (SRAM) which does not require data to be
                refreshed.</a> <br /><br />Unlike flash memory, DRAM is volatile memory (vs. non-volatile memory), since it loses its data quickly when power is removed. However, DRAM does exhibit limited data remanence.

            <p>In learning first thing i noticed it everything is connected to one single line or path called <a><b>8- bit Bus</b></a>. I am still not fulley aware of design here but i can say all the microcontroller controlling units means which
              help
              micro controller to synchronise on every <a>clock signal</a> are on right side of the 8 bit bus. On the left side of the bus <a><b>Processing unit</b></a> including <a>Memmory portion</a>, <a>Register</a>, <a>Logic unit(ALU)</a> is
              placed.<br /><br />

              i will write about this in clock signal part.But i can tell this clock works ccome to <a>Timer counter</a><br /><br />
              Here <a>WATCHCHDOG TIMER</a> create automatically system reset when it hangs if main program neglets to periodically service it.<br /><br />
              <a>INTERNAL Calibrated CLOCK</a> ia internal clock of micro-controller in microcontroller <a>ATtiny44</a> its maximum frequency is 8Mhz.

            </p><br />
            <h3>Clock</h3>
            This section is trying to explain clock system of the <a><b>ATTiny44</b></a>.
            <img src="images/week9/9.png" alt="" />
            <br />
            <p>
              <br /><br />
              Clock signal or pulse is used in digital circuits of sequential circuits for differentiating output with time . As in sequential circuits output ks fed back to input and new output will be given after every clock pulse.<br /><br />
              Applications <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)"><b>flip flops</b></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_timer_IC"><b>555 timer</b></a> etc <br /><br />
              Clock is used in digital circuit for the following reasons:
              <li>
                To synchroze the digital circuit.
              </li>
              <li>
                To produce the proper interval between two inputs and outputs.
              </li>
              <li>
                To produce th delay and generating square wave.
              </li>
              timing is everything in Digital Circuits. Without clocks digital circuits cannot run. Clocks control the input and output of the circuit and provide synchronisation for peripherals.Most integrated circuits (ICs) of sufficient complexity
              use a clock signal in order to synchronize different parts of the circuit, cycling at a rate slower than the worst-case <a><b>internal propagation delays</b></a>.

              <br /><br />
              <a>Propagation delay</a>
              In electronics, digital circuits and digital electronics, the propagation delay, or gate delay, is the length of time which starts when the input to a logic gate becomes stable and valid to change, to the time that the output of that
              logic gate is stable and valid to change.
              <br /><br />Often on manufacturers' datasheets this refers to the time required for the output to reach 50% of its final output level when the input changes to 50% of its final input level. Reducing gate delays in digital circuits
              allows
              them to process data at a faster rate and improve overall performance. The determination of the propagation delay of a combined circuit requires identifying the longest path of propagation delays from input to output and by adding each
              tpd time along this path. <a><b>Clock signal</b></a> interval should always be more than the propogation delay.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              In three electronics weeks this week was first when i was getting something in mind about terminologies , i got time to explore about microcontroller though. i programmed simple code which Arduino IDE but i also interested in learning
              other langauges too, in mean time i am going to try c programming to program my board.

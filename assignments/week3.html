          <h3 class="firstletter">I</h3>n week 3 we are introduced computer aided design (CAD). CAD is divided in 2 parts, 2d design and 3d design. As per name, 2d design is something like drawings we do on canvas and drafts which are made in
          engineering drawings. Its only based on 2 dimensions. in CAD we do 2d drawings in computers. 3d design is one step ahead, itâ€™s the use of computers to make the 3-dimensional prototypes. We can use those models to ideation and
          prototyping(simulation).<br><br>

          </div><br><br>
          We are introduced many cad tools and told which software is better for which work, what software would be more helpful in different situations and in which part they are better than others.<br><br>

          List of cad software is <b><a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_design/index.html">here</a></b>. choose your tool according to your need only! ;)<br><br>
          As you will see in list they are many options in list in both 2d and 3d design but I want to choose software which are new to me (on the basis of method of operating). I also wanted to research on some key ideas about 3d design which are
          Generative design concept and script-based cad software (software which uses scripting instead of different features to do different operations). <br><br>

          Generative design is research area in CAD which helps the designer to ideate in better way, it takes information of a prototype like load constrains, types of loads and operating conditions and presents different models which are able to
          satisfy requirements. you can get more information <b><a href="https://www.autodesk.com/solutions/generative-design">here</a></b>.
          <div>
            <img alt="Example of generative design" src="images/week3/gdc/1.png">
            <p>Concept of generative design from <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/blog-generative-design-optimization-creativity-best" target="_blank">webpage</a></p>

          </div><br><br>
          Script-based cad software are very fast when you have to so number of jobs in very less amount of time, traditional (history-based) softwares are very efficient for this type of jobs, because they work on history tree and take more
          re-computation time.<br><br>

          <p>We are going to make beautiful logo done by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmaYeZ5iDPo" target="_blank">logos by nick</a> on youtube.</p>
          <br><br>lets starts!<br>
          <h4>Follow this step:</h4>
          <div>
            <p class="step">STEP 1:MAking polygonal</p>
            <img alt="logo design inkscape" src="images/week3/inkscape/logowork/1.gif">
            <p>First make polygonal by polygonal tool and select number of sides 6 for Hexagonal.</p>
            <p class="step">STEP 2: Making and aligning circle</p>
            <img alt="logo design inkscape" src="images/week3/inkscape/logowork/2.gif">
            <p>Now copy the width of polygonal! lock them by icon shown in figure. it will maintain the dimension ratio. Now make a circle, press <b>CTRL + SHIFT</b> for perfect circle, then paste the dimensions on th circle's.<br><br>Change its
              color with colour plates below.<br><br>Now select circle, press <b>SHIFT</b> and select hexagonal then click vertical align and horizontal align tool at sides to make them align at both symmetry of axis.</p>
            <p class="step">STEP 3:How to substract sketches</p>
            <img alt="logo design inkscape" src="images/week3/inkscape/logowork/3.gif">
            <p>Select circle, click path > Duplicate(it will generate new circle).<br><br>Select circle, click path > difference(it will create difference between circle and polygonal).<br><br>elect circle, click path > break apart(it will separate
              entity)<br><br>Then go to Path > union (after SHIFT selecting both), colors will become same, in union sketches merges and become one sketch itself.</p>
            <p class="step">STEP 4: How to Clean dots</p>
            <img alt="logo design inkscape" src="images/week3/inkscape/logowork/4.jpg">
            <p>( optional: if you are getting those dots! just re-select sketch and go to path > break apart, it should work)</p>
            <img alt="logo design inkscape" src="images/week3/inkscape/logowork/16.jpg">
            <p class="step">STEP 5:how to convert strokes to path</p>
            <img alt="logo design inkscape" src="images/week3/inkscape/logowork/5.gif">
            <p>align both horizontal and vertically. <br><br>click brown polygonal and click lower selection to bottom. it will move the brown polygonal to lowest level.in this process brown polygonal should remain selected.<br><br>now click one
              color at below. if no changes seems set width at side panel(Took care of everything! ;)<br><br>Repeat the same process and give it different color.</p>
            <p class="step">STEP 6: Put a name on logo</p>
            <img alt="logo design inkscape" src="images/week3/inkscape/logowork/22.jpg">
            <p>Write something<br><br>Edit it! give uniform scale by hold <b>SHIFT</b> and <b>CTRL</b><br><br>Choose rectangle. change opacity and align it with text.<br><br>move it downward by scaling tool</p>
            <p class="step">STEP 7: Tracing image</p>
            <img alt="logo design inkscape" src="images/week3/inkscape/logowork/6.gif">
            <p>Import images for logo.<br><br>Convert in vector by convert to bitmap<br><br>these settings will work, if no try 5,6 colors .<br><br>Our bull is ready! Blue one is vector. you can put this images on logo.</p>
            <p class="step">STEP 8: give some background at photoshop</p>
            <img alt="logo design inkscape" src="images/week3/inkscape/logowork/27.jpg">
            <p>Here i used Photoshop for presenting. if you want it on good quality i will suggest you to open svg format to photoshop and then convert it on .jpeg</p>

            <p>
              Sometimes we need to edit over Sketches or edit different types of images, then we can use Photoshop softwares. Photoshop software is for raster editing and illustator can be used for illustrations and graphic work where dots are on
              mathematical relationships.<br><br>Now we will do raster work on photoshop
            </p>

            <p>Import image on the photoshop.press <b>CTRL + j</b> for new layer</p>
            <p class="step">STEP 2:using bucket tool</p>
            <img alt="Photoshop Raster work" src="images/week3/photoshop/2.jpg">
            <p>Click paint bucket for direct painting.(it is little inaccurate)</p>
            <p class="step">STEP 3:Adding different colors</p>
            <img alt="Photoshop Raster work" src="images/week3/photoshop/7.jpg">
            <p>Add more colors by bucket tool</b></p>
            <p class="step">STEP 4:rectangular tool</p>

          <h3 class="imagescane">Converting images into vectors with Photoshop and image scan</h3>
          when you are working on some project it is necessary to have some pen or paper! sketches are the simple and effective part of ideation, it is fast and you are not constrained as a designer. But sometimes we need to use those sketches in our
          computer work like explaining clients your product concept, editing some part of your ideas, agree everything can be done on computer now but some traditional options are still in value.<br><br>
          For solving above problems we can convert images into vector , after that we can edit text directly view computers, some premium softwares like illustrator is giving excellent facilities in illustrations and stuff but i decided to go for
          photoshop and inkscape. photoshop for clearing the brown-spots and inkscape because i found it great for previous Logo-design work and i want to know ow effective it is for image scanning in being open-source. you will get to learn basics
          about photoshop too.<br><br>

          <h4>Follow this step:</h4><br>
          <img alt="concept sketch of controller" src="images/week3/imagescan/1.jpg"><br><br>

          <div>
            <p class="step">STEP 1: Import sketches on photoshop</p>
            <img alt="Making the image Vector" src="images/week3/imagescan/1.jpg">
            <p>First import your sketches in photoshop. you will notice one layer panel (written background) in left. It shows your edition layers. it is very helpful in doing certain amount of task on picture without effecting each other. you will
              learn more about layers <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/in/photoshop/using/layer-basics.html">here</a>.</p>
            <p class="step">STEP 2:Use of layers</p>
            <img alt="Making the image Vector" src="images/week3/imagescan/2.jpg">
            <p>make new layer by pressing <b>CTRL + J</b>. by this your original picture will be safe for edit if some mistake occur. select that layer , now that layer is working layer ( Active layer)</p>
            <p class="step">STEP 3: Use of levels</p>
            <img alt="Making the image Vector" src="images/week3/imagescan/3.jpg">
            <p>Select levels above.
              <img alt="Making the image Vector" src="images/week3/imagescan/4.gif">
              <p>Follow this steps to open Color range. Color range will help you to find out brown-spots and you can minimise it. with eye dropper you have to find one spot and with that you can minimize every brown-spot every spot.for more about
                levels click <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/in/photoshop/using/levels-adjustment.html">here </a>. </p> <p class="step">STEP 5:use of spot healing tool</p>
              <img alt="Making the image Vector" src="images/week3/imagescan/5.jpg">
              <p>new layer added to your layer panel if it is deleted only level effect will eliminate.Click spot haling bruch showed in second image. as name tells it mixes up the image surface.<br><br>you can set values above for Tool.</p>
              <img alt="Making the image Vector" src="images/week3/imagescan/7.jpg">
              <p>Now clean the spots! You can zoom in by <b>ATRL + scroll</b></p>
              <p class="step">STEP 8:Exporting image for web</p>
              <img alt="Making the image Vector" src="images/week3/imagescan/8.jpg">
              <p>I've cleaned my images, After cleaning the images export for web. See different type of export options.</p>
              <img alt="Making the image Vector" src="images/week3/imagescan/9.jpg">
              <p>After selecting "Web option" select quality of image as your need and click save. Our photoshop work is finished norw open images in inkspace.</p>
              <p class="step">STEP 10: opening inscape for vectorizing image</p>
              <img alt="Making the image Vector" src="images/week3/imagescan/10.jpg">
              <p>give changes if you need , i have give basic idea of inkspace in above tutorial</p>

              For 3d modeling of my final modeling i selected two software's before: Autodesk And Solid edge. but due to time contains and different method of working i have to shift to Fusion360. i've good <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.instagram.com/classy_29/">experience</a> in cad with fusion-360, Solidworks, Rhino so i want to use different software, i will still find a way to explore solidedge.

              was done in Fusion-360, Thats why i was thinking about not to use in my 3d modeling process, but lack of time change my mind, i was going for solid-edge this time , but output is still great, fusion-360 is all in one software, it is
              well <b>"FUSION"</b> of Constructive solid modeling, Hard surface modeling, sheet-metal modeling, And simulation. yes it includes everything and it is cloud based software so takes minimum space.

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            This week i explored lot , i am familier with cad softwere so i got a chance to go more deep , i got time to <a><b>Learn</b></a> <a><b>Photoshop</b></a> and <a><b>inkscape</b></a> and also started exploring <a>autodesk</a> and <a><b>fusion-360</b></a> more. in these softweres i love to work with <a><b>Inkscape</b></a> more. it is really good softwere , gives tools similar to premium softwere in free version.

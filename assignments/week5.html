        <p>
          In week 5 we are introduced to electronics Production. we are asked to make our FabISP board. for that we need to learn how to design our circuit board, we are introduced to the printed circuit board (<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board" target="_blank"><b>PCB</b></a>).
        </p>

        <h1>Printed circuit board</h1>

        <p>
          The printed circuit board is basically a fiberglass board coated with <a><b>copper</b></a> traces <a><b>( paths on the PCB board which connects different components of circuit board like power, resistor, diodes )</b></a>. Copper traces are an essential part in the design of PCB, you may have seen in circuit board every traces or copper wire are arranged in a nice manner, it is important because the length of copper wire controls time delay of communication.

          <p class="step">PCB can be characterized by different layers:</h3>

              <li>SINGLE-SIDED PCB</li>
              <li>DOUBLE SIDED PCB</li>

            </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="step">Single Sided pcb</p>
        <p>
          In Single-Sided PCB copper layer is coated only one side, in this type of board components and joints are connected only one side. Single-sided printed circuit boards are easily designed and quickly manufactured. They serve as the
          most cost-effective platform in the industry.

        <p class="step">Double sided pcb</p>
        <p>
          In Double-sided PCB copper layer is coated on both sides allowing connections on both sides of boards. Double-Sided PCBs (also known as Double-Sided Plated Thru or DSPT) circuits are the gateway to higher technology applications. They allow for a closer (and perhaps more) routing traces by alternating between a top and bottom layer using vias. Today, double-sided printed circuit board technology is perhaps the most popular type of PCB in the industry.

        <h4>Multilayer PCBs</h4>
        in Multilayer PCBs circuit boards consists of more than two copper layers in which copper traces are inter connects two or different layers of circuit board, this boards are very useful for making multi-functional circuit boards. Unlike a
        Double-Sided PCB which only has two conductive layers of material, all multilayer PCBs must have at least three layers of conductive material which are buried in the center of the material.<br>

        <h4>Rigid PCBs</h4>
        There are different types of layers in pcb, so their inflexibility can vary. Rigid printed circuit boards use a solid, rigid substrate material like fiberglass that remains the board from twisting.<br>

        <h4>flex PCBs</h4>
        Generally, the substrate in a flexible board is a flexible plastic. This fundamental material permits the board to fit into forms that inflexible boards cannot & to turn or shift during use without harmful the circuits on the printed
        circuit board. Though flex boards tend to charge more to intend and create than rigid PCBs, they come with a number of advantages. For instance, they can restore heavy or bulky wiring in superior gear like satellites, where weight & space
        matter. Flex boards can also come in three formats, namely single sided, double-sided or multilayer formats.<br>

        <h3>electronic components</h3>
        An electronic component is any basic discrete device or physical entity in an electronic system used to affect electrons or their associated fields.They give the circuit the unique qualities that make it fit for its intended purpose.
        Depending on the device or electronic item a PCB is designed for, different components will be needed for different circuits. These components can consist of a wide range of electronic parts.<br><br>

        Before understanding the different type of components its necessary to know the type of technology they are goning to be used in. The technology is classified into two types as follows.<br><br>

        <h4>Through-hole technology (tht)</h4>
        In SMT Components are placed or mounted directly on the PCBs.In the industry it has largely replaced the through-hole technology construction method of fitting components with wire leads into holes in the circuit board.
        <h4>Surface-mount technology (SMT)</h4>
        Refers to the mounting scheme used for electronic components that involves the use of leads on the components that are inserted into holes drilled in printed circuit boards (PCB) and soldered to pads on the opposite side either by manual
        assembly (hand placement) or by the use of automated insertion mount machines. Through-hole components are best used for high-reliability products that require stronger connections between layers.

                Switches can come in many forms such as pushbutton, rocker, momentary and others. Their basic function is to interrupt electric current by turning a circuit on or off.

            <p>
              Resistors are used to resist the flow of current or to control the voltage in a circuit. The amount of resistance that a resistor offers is measured in Ohms. Most resistors have colored stripes on the outside and this code will tell
              you it’s value of resistance. You can use a multimeter or Digikey’s resistor color code calculator to determine the value of a resistor.
            </p>

          <h3>Variable Resistor (Potentiometer)</h3>

            <p>
              A variable resistor is also known as a potentiometer. These components can be found in devices such as a light dimmer or volume control for a radio. When you turn the shaft of a potentiometer the resistance changes in the circuit.
            </p>

            <p>
              A light-dependent resistor is also a variable resistor but is controlled by the light versus turning a knob. The resistance in the circuit changes with the intensity of the light. These are often found in exterior lights that
              automatically turn on at dusk and off at dawn.

              Capacitors store electricity and then discharges it back into the circuit when there is a drop in voltage. A capacitor is like a rechargeable battery and can be charged and then discharged. The value is measured in F (Farad), nano
              Farad (nF) or pico Farad (pF) range.

              A diode allows electricity to flow in one direction and blocks it from flowing the opposite way. The diode’s primary role is to route electricity from taking an unwanted path within the circuit.

              A light-emitting diode is like a standard diode in the fact that electrical current only flows in one direction. The main difference is an LED will emit light when electricity flows through it. Inside an LED there is an anode and
              cathode. Current always flows from the anode (+) to the cathode (-) and never in the opposite direction. The longer leg of the LED is the positive (anode) side.

              Transistor are tiny switches that turn a current on or off when triggered by an electric signal. In addition to being a switch, it can also be used to amplify electronic signals. A transistor is similar to a relay except with no
              moving parts.

              When working with circuits, you will often find something called a schematic diagram. These diagrams use symbols to illustrate what electronic components are used and where they’re placed in the circuit. These symbols are graphic
              representations of the actual electronic components.

          <p class="step">STEP 9 : removing extra solder coil</p>
          <p>removing extra Tin with copper wick ! after solder it was time for removing the extra solder coil from circuit to avoid <a><b>short-circuit</b></a> ! it is good practice to do.</p>

          <p> Samiul teaching us How to use instrument for validating our Circuits.</p>
          <img alt="pcbdesign" src="images/week5/pcbmilling/10.jpg">
          <p>With these instrument we check the whole circuit for any trace of short-circuit. this test should not be done before buzzer test, after passing buzzer test(<a>No buzzer means circuit is good for power checking</a>) </p>
          <img alt="pcbdesign" src="images/week5/pcbmilling/11.jpg">
          <p>by placing two connectors in power and ground, i checked for any leakage or short, if circuit is not fine, it will be red light beclow on instrument. See <a><b>BELOW</b></a>, if light is green your circuit is SAFE. </p>
          <img alt="pcbdesign" src="images/week5/pcbmilling/11a.jpg">
          <p>See ! if i'm connecting two connectors directly it turns out red, means it is shorted.</p>

          <p>Yes ! it is good for programming</p>

          <p class="step">STEP 11 : Programming the ISP-Board</p>
          <p> Before starting the programming the ISP-Board i solders, i Connected my junctions! it is necessary process for programminng ISP Board.After validating the ISP i started programming it. I follow <a
              href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/2018/labs/fablabcept/students/adhitya-ss/week-5"><b>Adhitya-ss</b></a>'s page for programming isp. I used linux for that.</p>
          <img src="images/week5/pcbprogramming/1s1.jpg">
          <p class="step">
            Installing prerequisites
          </p>
          <p>First i opened the terminal and and downloaded gcc and lib for compilation<br>
            in my machine i have already gcc-avr so didn't downloaded but here are the links for download.<br><br>
            Followed this step by step instruction to install gcc-avr
            The following are the commands used.
          <pre><code>sudo apt-get update</code></pre>
          <pre><code>sudo apt-get upgrade all</code></pre>
          <pre><code>sudo apt-get install gcc-avr binutils-avr avr-libc</code></pre>
          <pre><code>sudo apt-get install gdb-avr</code></pre>
          <pre><code>sudo apt-get install avrdude</code></pre>
          <p>You can also install all everything by</p>
          <pre><code>sudo apt-get install avrdude gcc-avr binutils-avr avr-libc make</code></pre>
          <p>I installed by this method<br /><br />

            Once all the lib and avrdude is setup, its time to download the firmware.The firmware can be downloaded from the following <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.16/doc/projects/ftsmin/fts_firmware_bdm_v1.zip"><b>link</b></a></p>
          <img alt="pcbdesign" src="images/week5/pcbprogramming/1a.jpg">
          </p>
          <p class="step">
            Go to firmware location
          </p>
          <p>
          <p>Then i navigated to desktop by using<br>
          <pre><code>cd ~/ desktop</code></pre>
          </p>
          then unzip the firmware at desktop<br>
          <a>unzip fts_firmware_bdm_v1.zip</a>
          <br>
          I connected my ISP to the programmer. Plugged one end to the USB and the other on the header.<br><br>
          Green Light: means that the header is soldered correctly<br>
          Yellow Light: means that the board is getting power, but most likely the 6-pin programming header is not soldered correctly(reflow solder joints, check for correction)<br>
          Red Light: means that the board is not getting power - check for shorts(<a><b>Buzzer test and Power test</b></a>).
          </p>

          <img alt="pcbdesign" src="images/week5/pcbprogramming/1ab.jpg">
          <p>Light on avrisp2 is green, so my ISP is ready to be programmed.</p>
          <p class="step">STEP 12 : Editing Make file</p>
          <p>This will build the <a><b>.hex</b></a> file that will get programmed onto the ATtiny45. First, update the Makefile for the type of programmer you're going to use to program your board. The Makefile, by default, assumes that you're
            going to use a programmer in the usbtiny family (e.g. another FabISP board). Other familier names are: <a><b>avrisp2</b></a>, <a><b>jtag2isp</b></a></p>
          <img alt="pcbdesign" src="images/week5/pcbprogramming/2a.jpg">
          <p>If you want to program isp with another module keep this settings or give name of ("<a><b>PROGRAMMER ?=</b></a>") font-weight microcontrollers name.<br><br>If you want to program another ISP then changes It To "<a><b>USBtinyspi</b></a>"
          </p>
          <p class="step">STEP 13 : Make flash</p>
          <p><a><b>This will erase the target chip, and program its flash memory with the contents of the .hex file you built before</b></a></p>
          <img alt="pcbdesign" src="images/week5/pcbprogramming/3.jpg">

          <p class="step">STEP 14 : make fuses</p>
          <p><a><b>This will set up all of the fuses except the one that disables the reset pin.</b></a></p>
          <img alt="pcbdesign" src="images/week5/pcbprogramming/5.jpg">

          <p class="step">STEP 15 : lsusb</p>
          <p> then plug out ISP from programmer and check it on the usb port then type <a><b>lsusb</b></a>, If you see a "Multiple Vendors USBtiny" device, it worked! If it didn't, the dmesg command might provide more info on what went wrong.
          </p>
          <img alt="pcbdesign" src="images/week5/pcbprogramming/6.jpg">

          <p class="step">STEP 16 : plugged in into laptop</p>
          <p> Then i unsoldered the junction and plugged in into my pc to see if it recognize! and yes it recognized it.<br><br> Then i solder it again and connected isp to the board second time and run the code <a><b>make rstdisbl</b>. This does the
              same thing as
              the make fuses command, but this time it's going to include that reset disable bit as well. You should see some progress bars, and with that, avrdude will never be able to talk to this chip again through the ISP header.
              <br><br>now, we need to disconnect VCC from the Vprog pin on the ISP header by <a><b>removing the bridge on the solder</b></a> jumper. Sometimes the excess solder will stick to a clean soldering iron tip; if not, use desoldering
              braid to remove the solder from the jumper, thus breaking the connection.</a></p>

          <p class="step">STEP 17 : Programming another ISP</p>
          <p>Then i checked my isp by connecting another one, and it was working</p>

        <h3>Group work</h3>
        <p>
          this week's group assignment was to characterize the machine. Since pcb milling was very new to most of us , we started with understanding from the beginning , before going to machine we liked to see the specifications of this machine and
          how we can use fab modules to use the Modela mdx-20. <br /><br />
          in group work i specially focus on the machine specifications and its modeling capabilities , i was intended to test the parameters and see thier effects on the final output. i saw how i can do clean cut by just increasing the offset and
          overlap. i knew it as <a><b>low chances</b></b></a> of breaking because it will cut lesser material in comperison. link for group work is <a href="http://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/cept/electronicsproduction" target="_blank"><b>Here</b></a>.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>conclusion :</h3>
        <p>This week was totally focused on learning new things, many new things i was applying in my Assignment specially Milling the circuit board, observing and understanding the Mdx-20, then doing soldering it was very good experience. i am
          still comfused about linux commands and about programming the microcontrollers but i will figure out that in up-coming weeks. </p>

          In week 4 we are introduced to computer controlled-cutting. In computer controlled-cutting we use computers to do fabrication processes. Instructions are given by codes of line which can be generated by manually
          or we can turn the geometries into codes. code which is used in machine for fabrication processes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code">"G-CODE"</a>. Gcode is numerical controlled programming language used in computer-aided
          manufacturing to control the automated machines.<br><br>

            <h3>vinyl cutting</h3>
            <h4 class="roland">Exploring Roland GX24</h4>
            <p>
              A vinyl cutter is a type of computer-controlled machine. Small vinyl cutters look like a desktop printer. Like a printer controls a nozzle, the computer controls the movement of a sharp blade over the surface of the material. This blade
              is used to cut out shapes and letters from sheets of thin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-adhesive_plastic_sheet"><b>self-adhesive plastic</b></a> (vinyl). The vinyl can then be stuck to a variety of surfaces depending on
              the adhesive and type of material. <br><br>
              To cut out a design a vector-based image must be created in a software program (usually <a href="https://www.adobe.com/in/products/illustrator"><b>Adobe Illustrator</b></a> or <a href="https://www.coreldraw.com/en/"><b>Corel
                  Draw</b></a>).<br><br> It is then sent to the cutter where it cuts along the vector paths laid out in the design. The <a href="http://am.co.za/plotter/blade"><b>cutter</b></a> is capable of moving the blade on an X and Y axis over
              the material, cutting it into any shape we are able to design but there will be <a><b>always</b></a> one perfect settings for each design depends on the geometry. Since the vinyl material comes in long rolls, projects with significant length like banners or billboards can be easily cut as well.<br><br> to know more about vinyl cutter you can <a

              <img alt="logo design inkscape" src="images/week4/vinylcutter/testing/2a.jpg"><br><br>

              <p>
                <a><b>TEST</b></a> : for testing the material or fixing the parameters like<br>
                <a><b>ORIGIN</b></a> : To set the origin of the machine<br>
                <a><b>PAUSE</b></a> : to pause the machine while running<br>
                <a><b>POSITION CONTROLLERS</b></a> : for positioning material and blade<br>
                <a><b>FORCE</b></a> : to enter the machine force<br>
                <a><b>PEN FORCE</b></a> : to give manual force while cutting operations (Increment / decrement)<br>
                <a><b>ENTER</b></a> : to select the required settings<br>
              </p>

              <p class="step">STEP 1: Doing test cuts</p>
              <p>First of all we go for test so we can know the cut abilities of vinyl cutter. I used <a><b>GSM - 20</b></a> material here, In <a><b>Test cut</b></a> wwe found out at which speed and force <a><b>Inner square</b></a> can be removed from circle smoothly.For test cut i found <a>Force = 150 gf</a> and speed <a>Speed = 20</a></p>

              <img alt="logo design inkscape" src="images/week4/vinylcutter/testing/5.jpg">


              <p class="step">STEP 2: Change the blade</p>
              <p>There was a issue we were finding in cuts they were not smooth as we imagined, so we try another blade and it was quite good</p>

            <h3>Logo making vinyl cutter</h3>

            <p>I decided to try my <a><b>Sherrif</b></a> logo which i made in <a href="http://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-prakashbhaipatel/assignments/week3#inkscape"><b>Week 3</b></a> in <a>INKSCAPE</a> softwere. it has good deatils in the fonts i can also able to know what will be my design limitations in logo making ,</p>

            <h3>Cut STUDIO softwere</h3>
                  <p>
                    I tried both <a><b>Vector</b></a> <a><b>Raster</b></a> formats for logo making. i wanted to see advantages of these two formats in machine operations. Cut studio can work on both vector and raster formats. you can import <a>raster images</a> of extensions <a>(.bmp, .jpg, .gif, .tif, .psd)</a> or <a>vector images</a> of <a>(.EPS or .ai)</a>.

                  </p>
                  <p class="step">Raster Image</p>
                  <p>
                    First ai went for raster image , raster image can be downloaded from above link .. as i say which vector formats you need to upload on the cut studio, Uploading Raster formats is easy you can just <a><b>import</b></a> it without any pre Processing.
                  </p>
                  <p class="step">
                    cut studio interface
                  </p>
                  <P>
                    This is <a><b>cut studio</b></a> interface , it is quit simple and easy to understand , you can import images from file menu here. here in defaul state <a><b>Origin</b></a> will be in bottom-left.
                  </P>
                  <img src="images/week4/vinylcutter/logomaking/1.png">

                    Import jpg format
                  </p>
                  <P>
                    only one limitation in raster formates are we can choose our cut paths directly we have to do some or cant generate all the desired path lines, we need to do some work on that by creating image outline to generate best paths we can. (lets understand this later). After importing jpg image or any raster format (JPG in my case) you can just <a><b>Right click</b></a> on image and select <a><b>Image outline</b></a>. first disable the image view.<br /><br /> <a>What we are doing here is we are setting different contrast of images to create different path lines , this paths are going to be usd by cutters. in dark part software will target the more dence colors and in light parts it will target bright ones. i have to select in between to generate tool path of image.</a>

                  <p>
                    After setting the outine we have to set the origin of the machine, what we can do here that one can set the cutter ate desired position and set that point as origin by clicking the origin button on the machine , that time origin for machine will be set. but we have to tell the software what is the cutting area.<br /><br />

                  For setting the cutting area we need to go <a>Cutting</a> > <a>Properties</a> and select <a> GET FROM MACHINE</a></p>

                  <p>
                    In Roland GX24 speed is <a><b>20 cm/s</b></a> in default. it is maximum speed of the machine , for my job it was <a><b>Too high</b></a>, letters can tear off during the cutting process. so i desided to keep it too 1 cm/s first. force was <a><b>150 gf</b></a>
                  </p>

                 reducing the force
                </p>  <p>
                  Antd it was cutting good.
                    Force was too high for cutting the material , so i decided to change it to the 110 gf.

                    After doing vinyl cutting on material, it is time to take logo out of it. It is little sensitive process it needs to be done with proper way otherwise logo will take bad shape and will not be good to put on somewhere(<a><b>Main objective</b></a>)
                  </p>
          <p class="step">
            Use of transfer tape
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://help.cricut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009430794-Transfer-Tape-Usage-instructions"<b>Transfer tap </b></a>
               is used to place the logo on the place where you want it to.

          <p class="step">
            Cutting out transfer tap</p>
            <p>
              First I cut the transfer tap i needed from roll and place it on the partsince our small roll of transfer was finished i have to take out bigger one and i cut one portion of it to place <a><b>transfer tap</b></a> on cut part

            </p>
          <img src="images/week4/vinylcutter/logomaking/postprocessing/2.jpg"  / />
          <p class="step">
            Pulling out unnecessary material
          </p>
          <p>
            I removed unnecessary material first ! For easy removal one should try to pull transfer tape <a><b>parallel to the surface</b></a> , in this case <a><b>shear</b></a> will help to remove the material , <a><b>directly pulling</b></a> it up may brake the material and it will one have to make logo <a><b>once again </b></a>.
          </p>

          <p class="step">
           Using transfer tape one more time
          </p>
          <p>
            then I took out <a><b>another transfer tap</b></a> and removed my logo from roll and place it where I wanted to .
            <br /><bR />
            <a>
              What one can do here is put the logo one the roll( its negative side ) if you don't want to stick that on instance and take it out when you need to , it helps when you have more than one logo to place.

          <p class="step">With vector format</p>
          <p>
            Then i did the same process with <a><b>vector format</b></a>, i used <a><b>.eps</b></a> format for it. <a><b>The difference between</b></a> these tipe of format i explained above , but vector formats are cery good when you need perfect cutting paths , it will conver all the vector lines in cut paths , but for that one will need vector formats , so i used <a><b>.svg</b></a> format , original file of inkscape. <a href="images/week3/inkscae/logodesign.svg" target="_blank" download><b>click</b></a> here to download.


            <br /><br />

            In vector format the cutting process is very simple , you dont have to make contrast changes to generate path , tool path will be there  initially , but more complex thing is converting or preparing the image for the <a><b>Cut studio</b></a> softwere. the procedure is little complex and need to follow some cirtain ground rules , i will not say method is not general but we need to use that for our cut studion version
          </p>
          <p class="step">
            .eps format
          </p>
          <p>
            as i written cut studio can run on <a><b>.eps</b></a> and <a><b>.Ai</b></a> formats. i tried with .eps format. i used <a><b>Inkscape</b></a> and illustrator to generate .eps format.
          </p>
          <p class="step">
            Convert text into paths
          </p>
          <p>
            it is good practice to convert text manually on paths. for doing that in inscape go to <a><b>Path > Dynamic offset</b></a> and select text.

          <p class="step">
            Inkscape
          </p>

          <p>
             you cant use export option in inkscape  to generate eps format , so go to <a><b>save as</b></a> and export the .eps file from there. you will find option to upload in <a><b>Postscript version</b></a>, i checked both looked same on eps format. But i recommend you to go for lower version , incase you have old system.</p><a href="images/week3/inkscape/logodesign2.eps"><b>click</b></a> here to download file.</p>

             <p class="step">
               export from Illustrator
             </p>
             <p>
               i exported with illustrator , i will show why i have to do it. but understand process. in illustrator one have to export in <a><b>illustrator 8 EPS</b></a>(for our cut studio version). <a href="images/week3/inkscape/logodesign.eps"><b>click</b></a> here to download file.

               visual comperisson
             </p>
             <p>
               below image is comperisson of eps file of inkscape and illustrator. both looks same , both have same path lines generated.<a>but the problem is when you import it in cut studio, for inkscape file when you add the file on software it will not show up , but illustrator file works good. thats why i have to chose illustrator for Uploading</a>
             </p>
             <img src="images/week4/vinylcutter/logomaking/vector/4b.jpg" alt="" />

               imported on cutstudio
             </p>
             <p>
              As i said toolpath will be generate il=initially and no additional process require to it , but one thing is to be take care of is to remove unwanted paths , sometimes in vector there are soem path line remained while designing. These will mess you logo in cut if you dont elliminate them.

             </p>
             <p>
               post processes are same in vector format as i mention on raster. but one <a>one advantage</a> is that you will may have more option about removing unnecessary material since each vector path is going to cut. below is image of vector cut logo.
             </p>

             <p>
               Here left one is <a>Raster</a> and <a>Vector</a>. i had better options to change font locations in vector. i could direct the toolpath more efficiently , but it is not good if you have more complex logo , i generally observe , <a>if some path is going through design it will cut throuh it and it can lead to bad postion while removing logo and unwanted material.</a>
               <br /><br />
               <a>For high contrast one can go for the raster type , it is also good for complex designs as far as softwere can detect edges properly.</a>

          <h3>Laser cutting</h3> <br>
          in <a><b>Laser cutting</b></a> we are assigned to make one <a><b>One press fitting</b></a> model using the concept of <a href="https://www.designtechsys.com/articles/parametric-modelling" target="_blank"><b>Parametric modeling</b></a>.
          <p class="step">Parametric modeling</p>
          <p>
            Parametric design is a process based on algorithmic thinking that enables the expression of parameters and rules that, together, define, encode and clarify the relationship between design intent and design response.<br /><br />

            Parametric design is a paradigm in design where the relationship between elements is used to manipulate and inform the design of complex geometries and structures.<br/><br />

            The term parametric originates from mathematics (parametric equation) and refers to the use of certain parameters or variables that can be edited to manipulate or alter the end result of an equation or system.<br /><br />

            <a>in conclusion Parametric design helps designer to modify the design very efficiently , in simple words i take one dimention and take it as a main parameter which effects other parameters directly or indirectly , i will try to relate it with other dimentions as a set of equation , which i already have to follow in simple modeling also , this set of equation will help to redesign the model quickly , if i change one parameter, all  dimentions related to it will change , in complex design there can be more than one parameter which are main or call it dominant in design.</a>

            <br><br />
             in Maths  dominant parameters can be called <a><b>Independent parameter</b></a> and other parameters as <a><b>Dependent parameters</b></a>, because their values depend on other parameters.
          </p><br />
          <h3>How it works ?</h3>
          <p>
             i prepared some basic model of parametric modeling to understand how i can use it in proper way , i initially used <a><b>Constrains</b></a> to have relationd between vertices , these constrains dont follow any expression , they follow simple geometric rules. <a>List</a> is below
             <li>
               parallel rule - lines will be parrallel to each in design
             </li>
             <li>
               Horizontal/verticle rule - lines will be horizontal or verticle no in between angle will be there.
             </li>
             <li>
               perpendicular rule - two line will be perpendicular to each other.
             </li>
             <li>
               Symetric rule -design will be symetric to respective axis
             </li>
             <li>
               equal rule - two line will be equal to each other.
             </li>
             <div>
              <p class="step">
                Skecth with constrains
             </p>
             <p>
               Below is simple sketch i prepared and i used constrains like <a><b>equal</b></a>, <a><b>perpendicular</b></a>, <a><b>parrallel</b></a>, <a><b>horizontal</b></a>, <a><b>Symetric</b></a>. in this design i have to think which parameter i should chose to be dominant , so i have work related to <a><b>press-fittings</b></a>. i chose slot thickness as main parameters , because thickness of the material vary and you may have to work on multiple material in press fittings , so here only slot thickness is dominant , and i relat it which othe parameters. see below images to have idea.
               <img src="images/week4/lasercutter/pressfitting/paratest/1.png" alt="" />
            <p class="step">
              Parameters
            </p>
             <p>
               In <a><b>Modify</b></a> menu click <a><b>parameters</b></a> to give the dimentions names , this names will represent the dimentions and it will be easy to work with names. Below is the image of my list of parameters , i choose thickness as dominant one and it is related to other one.
             </p>
             <img src="images/week4/lasercutter/pressfitting/paratest/2.png" alt="" />
             <p class="step">
               Other sketches relation
             </p>
             <p>
               Here is relation of thickness to other sketches , i used diagoonal because it is able to controll the both sides of the square. no need to give every side relation. here <a><b>Slot</b></a> dimention is not used in design , i gave it when i was figuring out whole parametric relation.
             </p>

             <p class="step">
               relations in sketch
             </p>
             <p>
               you can put relations directly on sketch plane. see below images, just define <a><b>your dominant dimention( mine thickness)</b></a> first , like <a><b>Thickness = 3.21mm</b></a> and then give relationms like below.

KERFING
            </p>

            For press fit cutting i have to make one comb for measuring <a href="http://www.cutlasercut.com/resources/tips-and-advice/what-is-laser-kerf"><b>kerfing</b></a>. kerfing is removal of material by the the laser in process, so it will be
            always dimension difference in the parts you want to join from the original one. for componset the removal of the Material , one may have to add or substract dimention from original one on cad.<br><br>to measure kerf of the material
            <li>
              cut one squre on laser , measure its dimention by calliper
            </li>
            <li>
              substract original(CAD) dimention with measured one
            </li>
            <li>
              Devide the value by <a><b>2</b></a>, it will kerf of the material.

            <p class="step">
              Comb test
            </p>

            To know which dimention is good for the material <a><b>Comb test is necessary</b></a>. In comb test original dimention may Increment in some fraction (i.e., make some at w-.002″, w-.001″, w+.001″, w+.002″ etc. w is original dimention) <a>Use kerf value on increment/decrement</a>. and after cutting you can test each slot by fitting in each one. Try to figure out which dimention is good to apply on the design and select it.<br /><br />
            In my case i was working on the material which thickness is <a><b>3.25 mm - MDF</b></a><br><br>

              <p>
                In laser cutting we have <a><b>SIL - laser engraver machine</b></a>. it is co2 based laser engraving machine. since it is co2 based laser engraver it can not cut the metal, but it has good results with the materoials like <a>MDF</a>, <a>plywood</a>, <a>Thin wood sheets</a>, <a>buff board</a>, <a>cement board</a>, <a>Acrylic</a>. these are the MATERIALs i tried with machine i placed details on <a href="http://fab.academany.org/2019/labs/cept/computercontrolledcutting" target="_blank"><b>group work</b></a>.

            <h3>RHINO AND grasshopper</h3>

          during trials i found some problems with the Fusion-360. Softwere was taking to much load time when i was changing Parameters, it was beyond my machine's limitations so i go for <a><b>Rhino</b></a> and
            <a><b>grasshopper</b></a>.i was familier with rhino but i have no idea how to use it for parametric design , through it was for parametric designs i was sure i can use it for good. i saw last year fab academy student <a href="http://fab.academany.org/2018/labs/fablabcept/students/adhitya-ss/"><b>Adhitya-ss</b></a> documentation for any clue in parametric softweres.
            <br><br />and i found solution. this vedio is teaching to creat <a><b>Notches</b></a> on geometry. i followed the whole process.

<code>
  <li>Thickness of material: 1.5 mm</li>
  <li>Power for cut : Power max: 40 %, Power min: 35 %</li>
  <li>Power for Texts and etching: Power max: 7 % Power min: 40 %</li>
  <li>Speed for text:	200 mm/s</li>
  <li>Suitable for Etching: only up to 70 % power(IN SIL)</li>
  <li>Minimum diameter can be cut: 1 mm</li>
  <li>  Kerfing: 0.07 mm</li>
  <li>Minimum text can be cut: 1 mm</li>

              <h3>general conclusion about SIL :</h3>
<pre>
<code>
<li>Speed and accuracy : talking about the <a><b>speed</b></a> with <a><b>accuracy</b></a> SIL got 8/10 in <a>Etching</a>. because in my conclusion these two parameters are applied at a single time. it matters how laser engraves when it is on high speed , <a>Did the laser covers the whole printed part uniformly or not ?</a>, In SIl yes it can , it is engraving on narrow edges very precisely.</li>
<li>Minimum spacing between two cut profile: From my observation laser can give good results with spacing of <a>1.5 mm</a> , it can go to <a>1.3 mm</a> but some material like buff board it was not that good</li>
<li>Minimum Size of text : 3 mm preferable</li>
<li>Curved paths : In Arcs laser use minimum power settings because there is slow down in <a><b>Speed</b></a>.</li>

            <h3>COMPUTER CONTROLLED MACHINING WEEK</h3>
            <p>
             In computer controll Machining week i have done some work in <a><b>Parametric design</b></a> and <a><b>Laser cutting</b></a>. In <a><b>Week 8 i designed Plnatery gear Box</b></a>. since i never made gears i wanted to understand it first in real, so i made one protoype using the <a><b>Laser cutter</b></a>. The whole system is parametric so i dont have to redesign everything if something goes wrong.
             <br /><br />

            </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              This week i finally started working with machines, i learned things which are very new to me and things i always wanted to do, to make it(my designs) work on real life. now computers are smart enought to make any type of 3d or 2d design we want but one always have to think about some constrains and try to overcome creatively if they want designs in physical environment. i think that i wanted to do so far and from these week i began.<br><br />

              in <a>vinyl cutter</a> i learn to controll the speed and force to do cut part right , for more complex design one will also have to think about its easy and better removal.
              <br /><br />

              in laser cutting <a><b>SIL</b></a> is very good laser cutter but it also comes with some limitations, limitations i have written on the group work sections. in my design <a><b>Kerfing</b></a> was only limiting parameters which can effect the construction. overall week was good. :)

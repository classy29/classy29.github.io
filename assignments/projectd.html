<h3>divided  Project on two phases</h3>
<p>
  My final project is to design <a><b>Interactive Dustbin system</b></a>. i divided  this project in <a><b>two phases</b></a>.<br /><br /> in <a><b>Phase 1</b></a> dustbin System will be able to detect presence of individual, will be able to open and close by itself and try to manage the garbage by measuring its quantity inside. This part i am going to do in fab lab , if i will able to complete it earlier i will work on <a><b>Phase 2</b></a>, if not i will keep it as my final project.<br /><br />
  In <a><b>Phase 2</b></a>, I want to make this system for commercial application in which dustbin will be owned by the <a><b>Shopkeepers</b></a> and <a><b>for trusts who manages Historical sites</b></a>. In that model i am thinking about point system which will give points after use, and those points will give help to give discounts in near by shops. <br /><br />
  <h3>Why dividing in 2 phases ?</h3>
   initially my idea was to make <a><b>One commercial model</b></a>. One can check the project model on <a href="http://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-prakashbhaipatel/assignments/week1" target="_blank"><b>Final project Concept</b></a>. There i described it on details.<br /><br /> <a><b>Reason</b></a> to divide in phases is i found i may have the problems regarding the <a><b>programming the system</b></a>. i know basics in <a><b>Arduino C</b></a> and <a><b>C programming</b></a> , but for programming the RFID module will need me more learning time , though i prepared my final board the way i can easily add the <a><b>RFID - module</b></a> so if some time left i can work on that also.
</p>
<h3>Who's done beforehand ?</h3>
<p>
  There are many example where people tried to do automation in dustbin. in some projects they use <a><b>ultrasonic sensor and the servo</b></a> to make the opening open or close by detecting disturbance. In one project one used <a><b>Mic with Arduino</b></a> and servo, it will detect the sound and open the <a><b>Opening</b></a>. he is controlling servo with drivers.<br /><br />

   <a>One project is very similar to what i am thinking for  phase one</a>. it includes LCD module, Ultrasonic sensor, Infrared sensor with Arduino. They are using <a><b>Infrared sensor</b></a> to detect the objects and <a><b>Ultrasonic sensor</b></a> to measure the quantity.
   <br /><br />

   <p>
     This projects were amazing i gain more clear perspective after watching this videos, But these are personal projects and done for only short of demonstration of system not for public use. <a><b>What i want to implement here </b></a>is i want to modify this system for Public use , People will not use/buy it if it is not looking good enough or <a><b>it not reliable</b></a> and manufactures will not manufacture if it not <a><b>convenient for sell</b></a> or <a><b>convenient for make</b></a>.
   </p>
   <h3>What will I design?</h3>
   <p>
     As i mentioned above i wanted to make one system which is complete or semi-Automated . For <a><b>phase one</b></a> i am making it complete Automated , i this Ultrasonic sensor will detect for disturbance or object continuously , <a><b>When it will detect objects in between some distance it will triggers the Motor to open the dustbin.</b></a>.<br /><br />
     For phase - 2 i will like to make it semi-automatic. i will not give power continuously to the Ultrasonic instead i will add one push button for the people so system can start , it is more convenient idea for me for the commercial use.

       <p>
         Below image was first picture of what i wanted to make in final project. i wanted to make <a><b>wireless communication</b></a> between dustbin and main controller. if some one push the button dust bin will open , after throwing trash bin will give points using <a><b>RFID - module</b></a>.

      <h3>Some research in joineries</h3>
      <p>
         Apart from renders i started thinking about how my real dustbin will look like and how its joinery will be i wanted to do try some wood joinery on the dustbin specially <a><b>Japanese joineries</b></a> , i started doing some research one wood dustbins and possible joints i can use in project.
         <br /><br />
         At beginning i went for standard joinery which are used in woods. below are some examples !
      </p>

<br /><br /><br />
<h3>Butt joints</h3><br />
<div class="logodata">
  <img class="logo" src="images/finalproject/1.jpg">
  <p>
    These are just two pieces of wood attached perpendicularly to each other, often with nails or screws. They can be perfectly good joints but will have no structural integrity on their own.<br /><br />
    Butt joints can be your go-to when the work is rough or rustic or when speed matters more than looks. Just make sure your joining technique is right for the job (you might also need a <a><b>metal corner bracket</b></a> for extra strength, for instance). To dress up a butt joint you can either countersink or plug your nail/screw holes.
  </p>

<h3>Pocket screws</h3>

  </p>
<h3>Biscuit screws</h3><br /><br />
<div class="logodata">
  <img class="logo" src="images/finalproject/4.jpg">
  <p>
    This method involves gluing wooden “biscuits” into slots cut into the wood. It's an excellent way to hold together pieces of plywood or other engineered material, providing plenty of gluing surface as well as the strength of the biscuits themselves.<br /><br />

Biscuits are good for casework and for reinforcing and lining up edge joints, but layout can be confusing until you get the hang of it.
  </p>
  </div>
<br>

<h3>Miter joints</h3><br />
<div class="logodata">
  <img class="logo" src="images/finalproject/2.jpg">
  <p>
    I'm including miters here because on their own they are only as strong as the glue holding them together. They have more glue surface than a straight butt joint — a plus. But the joint is still end grain, which is notorious for not taking glue well.<br /><br />

Thanks to the super strength of new glues, a small box made only with miters will usually hold just fine. Still, adding a spline is a good idea.<br /><br />

Miters with splines look nice, so the joint itself can add to the design. The biggest negative is weakness. You will also need to take extra time to set the joint up properly so it has no gaps.
  </p>
</div>
<br>

<h3>finger joints</h3><br />
<div class="logodata">
  <img class="logo" src="images/finalproject/3.jpg">

  <p>
  This a good example of a ‘finger’ or ‘comb’ joint. It is ideal for box constructions and is suitable for use with natural woods such as pine and mahogany or even manmade boards such as plywood and MDF. The joint is strong especially when used with a good quality glue such as PVA (woodworkers adhesive).<br /><br />

If the joint is cut accurately the ‘fingers should fit together without any gaps and the glue ensures that they are virtually indestructible. They are used for a wide range of products including jeweler boxes, cabinet construction, kitchen cupboards and many others. (Example below - a box containing an electronic game for a young child - notice the finger joints).
  </p>

<br /><br />
<a href="https://www.leighjigs.com/gallery/square-finger-joints-gallery/0" target="_blank"><b>image source</b></a>

<p>
  i <a><b>decided</b></a> to go for finger joint first , Reason i want to work with finger joint first because of its <a><b>Simplicity</b></a> and it is believed ideal for box making , i also want to try out <a><b>Biscuit joint</b></a> as well , i am  thinking about testing possible joineries so i can have better idea in my design.

        Second cad design i made was more robust for me , hard to break constrains. then i started adding sections on it , i made it two layered so , no matter what type of garbage it is , it will stay away from main system and wiring.

       <p class="step">
         Failure
       </p><br /><br />
       After First Mechanism failed , i started working on the new mechanism , i knew servo was capable enough to lift the <a><b>3 mm MDF</b></a> flapper , i had idea of servos load capacity , somehow i made some mistake somewhere . <br /><br />
       <h4>Failure Reasons</h4>
       <li>
         I half the torque by base <a><b>Z-Rod</b></a> Design
       </li>
       <li>
         I put the <a><b>Pivot point of vertical rod</b></a> where moment is maximum and it cant be go up.
       </li>
       <li>
        third reason is not related with design it is related with time , i made so many inter related components that it will be hard to assemble and work with
       </li>
      <h4>Solution</h4>
      <li>
        Transfer the load directly from the servo to Flapper
       </li>
       <li>
         Reduce the Components needed if it can
       </li>

       Flapper mechanism will directly connect the <a><b>Servo</b></a> to the <a><b>Flapper</b></a>. it also looks like '<a><b>One</b></a>' - One element.

         Final Code
       </p>

        I Have Explained Final Code in comments Below ,  In summary i am working with <a><b>Servo</b></a>, <a><b>Ultrasonic sensor</b></a>, and <a><b>RFID module</b></a>.
        I thought something like below image in initial thinking and most of it i am able to achieve so far ,  yes <a><b>Things</b></a> like Displays i would like to use on bigger model and i replaced input to Ultrasonic sensor to give more Automation.  but i couldn’t use second ultrasonic system so far.

        problem Was i couldn’t understand how i will trigger the RFID module by giving some instance ultrasonic value , because dump will be triggered by inner ultrasonic at instance and as user i can throw dump and use tag at same time , i knew it may have some solution but as a time constraints , i went for less promising solution.

        <p class="step">

       <p class="step">
         Solution was Delay
       </p><br />
       Freezing the system for Five minutes after one regarding was solution. I triggered Rfid module automatically after servo code is finish , Code executes from top to bottom  and it will <a><b>freeze</b></a> for Five minutes. So user will not cheat to get points !

<h3>RFID and PLX-DAQ</h3>
 i Prepared the code to geth the data of the RFID tag but it should be represents in shopkeepers Data base for point system , i was finding that solution eith code and i <a><b>Got one</b></a> , i used <a href="https://www.parallax.com/downloads/plx-daq" target="_blank"><b>PLX-DAQ</b></a> interface which takes data via <a><b>COM ports</b></a> by which any Serial Data Transfer device is connected and Arranges it on Columns of the Excel sheet !
<br /><br />I <a><b>Suggest one</b></a> to download PLX-DAQ <a href="https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=437398.msg3013761#msg3013761" target="_blank"><b>version 2</b></a>. first version has limited com ports so option for needed com port may not be there , in second one, one can write com ports number !
 For my case i needed <a><b>wireless</b></a> device and it should be easily connect with Computers i choose Bluetooth for That !<br /><br />
 <li>
   I took the data from RFID reader
 </li>
 <li>
   Transfered it thought hardware serial (Rx, Tx)
 </li>
 <li>
   Bluetooth Transferred it to Computer PLA-DAQ interface by Selecting Com-port
 </li>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          It is last time I am typing any Conclusion regarding My weeks ! i will give my Conclusion about my whole fab academy experience though ! Fab academy has succeed to give me what i wanted to do from last <a><b>Couple of years</b></a>. i had no making experience back so far , never new any machines even simple Jig - saw one , never used hammer in life (little embarrassing) ! in short , never done anything related to making when i started doing cad i knew i needed this experience i intended to design things which can help in real world and as i told i had no product design experience of real world. So it experience was <a><b>Great</b></a>for me!<br /><br />
          i am not saying i had always good time in my fab academy and things worked out as i wanted to , i cant even remember things which i made it work in first try ! what i remember and being happy about are the things which i tried and made it happen Some how, like a <a><b>Maker</b></a>.<br /><br />Hope i get the chance to work with Fab academy Again !

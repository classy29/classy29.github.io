        <p> In week 7 we aree going to design our own <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.14/people/sean_ricks/electronicsdesign.html"><b>echo hello-world board</b></a> using <a
            href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview"><b>Eagle</b></a> or <a href="http://kicad-pcb.org/"><b>Kicad</b></a> and we have to fabricate it. we have to attache LED and button to the circuit for check the working of
          micro-controller. <br><br>
          i started from the basics fundamentals like <a>Current</a>, <a>Voltage</a>, <a>Resistance</a>. i am familiar with them because in mechanical we are quite used to deal with Electronic fundamentals(<a>Theories</a>) but applying it in real
          life or something i am going to use in my final project it was different thing.<br><br></p>

        <h3>What is Circuit ?</h3>
        <div class="logodata">
          <img class="logo" src="images/week7/helloboard/circuit.jpg">
          <p>
            <a><b>In electronics</b></a> , a circuit is a path between two or more points along which an electrical current can be carried.This circular path, which is always required to get electricity to flow and do something useful, is called a
            <a><b>Circuit</b></a>. A circuit is a path that starts and stops at the same place.
          </p>
        </div><br><br>
        *Benjamin Franklin originally wrote that electricity flows from the positive side of a voltage source to the negative side. However, Franklin had no way of knowing that electrons actually flow in the opposite direction - at the atomic level,
        they come out of the negative side and loop back to the positive side. Because engineers followed Franklin's lead for hundreds of years before the truth was discovered, we still use the "wrong" convention to this day. Practically speaking
        this detail doesn't matter, and as long as everyone uses the same convention, we can all build circuits that work just fine.<br><br>
        I <a><b>get</b></a> to learn some terms like <a>Load</a>, <a>Short circuit</a>, <a>open circuit</a>.
        <h4>What is load ?</h4>
        We want some output by circuits thats why we are using them, it can be Light the bulb, running the programmes, making noise.<br><br>
        <div class="logodata">
          <img class="logo" src="images/week7/helloboard/load.jpg">
          <p> These things are called loads, because they “load down” the power supply. it’s possible to load down a power supply too much, which will slow down the current flow, it’s also possible to load down a circuit too little - this may let too
            much current flow (imagine running too fast if you weren’t carrying any weight), which can burn out your parts or even the power supply.</p>
        </div>
        <br><br>
        <h4>What is short circuit ?</h4>
        It's <a><b>Something Bad will happen !</b></a><br><br>
        <a><b>Don't</b></a> try this but if you directly connect positive and negative power supply. you'll create what is called a short circuit.<br><br>
        If you DO have a load in the current, the current flow through your circuit will be limited to that which your device consumes, which is usually a very small amount. However, if you DON'T put anything in to restrict the current flow, there
        won't be anything to slow down the current, and it will try to be infinite!<br><br>
        <div class="logodata">
          <img class="logo" src="images/week7/helloboard/ss.jpg">
          <p>Your power supply can't provide infinite current, but it will provide as much as it can, which may be a lot. This could cause your wire to burn up, damage the power supply, drain your battery, or other exciting things. Most of the time
            your power supply will have some sort of safety mechanism built into it to limit the maximum current in the event of a short circuit, but not always. This is the reason all homes and buildings have circuit breakers, to prevent fires from
            starting in the event of a short circuit somewhere in the wiring.</p>
        </div><br><br>
        <h4>What is integrated circuit ?</h4>
        An integrated circuit, or IC, is small chip that can function as an amplifier, oscillator, timer, microprocessor, or even computer memory. An IC is a small wafer, usually made of silicon, that can hold anywhere from hundreds to millions of
        transistors, resistors, and capacitors. These extremely small electronics can perform calculations and store data using either <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/digital"><b>Digital</b></a> or <a
          href="https://techterms.com/definition/analog"><b>Analog technology</b></a>.<br><br>
        <div class="logodata">
          <img class="logo" src="images/week7/helloboard/ic.jpg">
          <p>Every electronic appliance we use in our day-to-day life,such as mobile phones, laptops, refrigerators, computers, televisions and all other electrical and electronic devices are manufactured with some simple or complex circuits.
            Electronic circuits are realized using multiple electrical and electronic components connected with each other by connecting wires or conducting wires for the flow of electric current through the multiple components of the circuit, such
            as resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, transistors, and so on.</p>

                  <h3>Programming Board</h3>
                  <p>
                  I am going to program the <a><b>echo hello board</b></a>. there was a missing resister in echo hello in my design , i noticed it later , it was connected between vcc and reset pin , will not effect working anyway.
                  </p>
                  <p class="step">
                    Arduino tiny core

                  <p>
                    you have to paste <a>"http://drazzy.com/package_drazzy.com_index.json"</a> on the additional board manager section

                  <h3>Controlling the blink of Led</h3>
                  <p>
                    For see the Micro controllers action on the LED i Decided to make one relation between Switch and the LED.<br /><br />
                    code with the Switch. Since i put the Switch to the the PA3(<a><b>Arduino pin 3</b></a>) and LED to the PA2(<a><b>Arduino pin 2</b></a>)
                      in general i have written a code which tell the microcontroller to controll the led blinking when i am pushing the button. <a href="images/week7/process/blinkcode.ino" target="_blank" download><b>Code link</b></a>. here i am giving power throught the <a><b>FTDI</b></a>.<br />

                  <br />
                   I written the code to tell the microcontroller that if Switch pin is low then let led blink faster , and if switch pin is High then slow the blink rate of led , i am controlling the blink with <a><b>delay()</b></a> function.
                </p>

                      And then burn the bootloader.<br /><br /> Burning the bootloader will set the fuses to the Microcontroller , it will set the Clock rate on the input and output pin. it will also alow to upload program using the <a href="https://www.ftdichip.com/Products/Cables/USBTTLSerial.htm" target="_blank"><b>FTDI - TTL convertor</b></a> you will not need programmer after burning the bootloader once. <a href="https://www.engineersgarage.com/tutorials/bootloader-how-to-program-use-bootloader" target="_blank"><b>click here</b></a> to know more.

                  <p>
                    In Electronic design , group work is to  use the different test equipment in our lab to observe the operations of microcontroller in Circuit board.
                    <br /><br />
                    we have

                    </li>
                  <br /> in group work there are not such more tasks which can be devided so we did it together , i get to learn <a><b>Oscilloscope</b></a> in group work , how can i use it to get perfect delay between the data transmission. we did that on neils Bigbanging code. everything is written in detail in <a href="http://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/cept/electronicsdesign.html" target="_blank"><b>group web-site</b></a>.

                  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                  <p>
                    Electronics weeks are totally focused on learning new things and understanding vierd names though, Still i am getting used to it. <a>What i learn this week</a> is only way to learn electronics is to do it over and over again. Here
                    failure of the circuit is normal thing, It doesnt matter how many time you give to orient board diagram and design the schematic if led didnt blink or microcontroller got hot after plug in you probabily messed up something and you
                    are lucky if you got to know what is wrong with your circuit. :/ Still week was <a><b>Great</b></a>.

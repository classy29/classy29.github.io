        I am familiar with them because in mechanical we are quite used to deal with Electronic fundamentals(<a><b>Theories</b></a>) but applying it in real life or something I am going to use in my final project it was a different thing.</p>

      <h1>What is Circuit ?</h1>
      <div class="circuit">
        <div class="circuit-compo">
          <div class="circuit-compo-images">

          <p>
            <a><b>In Electronics</b></a>, a circuit is a path between two or more points along which an electrical current can be carried. This circular path, which is always required to get electricity to flow and do something useful, is called a
            <a><b>Circuit</b></a> A circuit is a path that starts and stops at the same place.

            <br><br>

            *Benjamin Franklin originally wrote that electricity flows from the positive side of a voltage source to the negative side. However, Franklin had no way of knowing that electrons flow in the opposite direction - at the atomic level, they
            come out of the negative side and loop back to the positive side. Because engineers followed Franklin's lead for hundreds of years before the truth was discovered, we still use the "wrong" convention to this day. Practically speaking this
            detail doesn't matter, and as long as everyone uses the same convention, we can all build circuits that work just fine.

            <br /><br />

            I get to learn some terms like Load, Short circuit, open circuit.

          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h1>What is load ?</h1>
      <div class="circuit">
        <div class="circuit-compo">
          <div class="circuit-compo-images">
            <img src="images/week7/helloboard/load.jpg">
          </div>
          <p> These things are called loads because they “load down” the power supply. it’s possible to load down a power supply too much, which will slow down the current flow, it’s also possible to load down a circuit too little - this may let too
            much current flow (imagine running too fast if you weren’t carrying any weight), which can burn out your parts or even the power supply.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h1>What is short circuit ?</h1>
      <div class="circuit">
        <div class="circuit-compo">

          <p>
            If you directly connect positive and negative power supply. you'll create what is called a <a><b>short circuit</b></a>.<br><br>
            If you do have a load in the current, the current flow through your circuit will be limited to that which your device consumes, which is usually a very small amount. However, if you don't put anything in to restrict the current flow,
            there won't be anything to slow down the current, and it will try to be <a><b>infinite</b></a>!
            <br><br>
            Your power supply <a><b>can't provide infinite current</b></a>, but it will provide as much as it can, which may be a lot. This could cause your wire to burn up, damage the power supply, drain your battery.
            <br /><br /> Most of the time
            your power supply will have some sort of safety mechanism built into it to limit the maximum current in the event of a short circuit, but not always. This is the reason all homes and buildings have circuit breakers, to prevent fires from
            starting in the event of a short circuit somewhere in the wiring.</p>

            An integrated circuit, or IC, is a small chip that can function as an amplifier, oscillator, timer, microprocessor, or even computer memory. An IC is a small wafer, usually made of silicon, that can hold anywhere from hundreds to millions
            of
            transistors, resistors, and capacitors. These extremely small electronics can perform calculations and store data using either <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/digital" target="_blank"><b>Digital</b></a> or <a
              href="https://techterms.com/definition/analog" target="_blank"><b>Analog technology</b></a>.

            Every electronic appliance we use in our day-to-day life,such as mobile phones, laptops, refrigerators, computers, televisions and all other electrical and electronic devices are manufactured with some simple or complex circuits.
            Electronic circuits are realized using multiple electrical and electronic components connected with each other by connecting wires or conducting wires for the flow of electric current through the multiple components of the circuit, such
            as resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, transistors, and so on.</p>

        <p>These components are essential to program the controller or to work with any microcontroller.</p>

        <p class="step">Net tool</p>
        <p>What <a><b>Net tool</b></a> do is, it gives connections between the components, its just like virtual wires which help us to visualize the circuit better and try to give a perfect explanation of how the components on the circuit board are
          connected.</p>
        <p>
          <img src="images/week7/process/6.png" alt="">

        <p class="step">Name tool</p>
        <p>You can connect the components by directly joining both the components with nets or by giving a specific name on each side of the net with the <a><b>Name tool</b></a>. These names help us to connect the components without making it
          complex.</p>

        <p>This is a complete schematic of my first design, I <a><b>Request</b></a> not to follow this schematic if you are, I made mistake on schematic since I had no information of where to put the Switch I put it on rest pin and its functionality
          will change It will reset the board instead of controlling the LED, I will redirect you to working schematic. as I was designing the first time I was not sure about these mistakes, so I kept on and mad one board.
        <h1>Mistakes</h1>
        <pre>
<code>
<li>I gave names improperly.</li>
<li>I connected my switch with the reset pin of the microcontroller, It will not full-fill my objective here (it will not give a signal to pc instead it will reset my micro-controller, which is a good thing for big boards or different applications).</li></code>

        <p class="step">
          Schematic errors
        </p>
        <p>I got some schematic errors, Error was for values, if you are simulating the circuit or giving the schematic to another person or if you are going to use it after some time, you got to put values there, I didn't because I was
          experimenting. for pulling out resistor and power capacitors I have given the values above. and I am going to use a 10k <a><b>Resistor</b></a> with <a><b>LED</b></a>.</p>

          Below is the Clearance section. you can decide <a><b>How much</b></a> clearance you will need between these <a><b>Wire</b></a>, <a><b>Pads</b></a>, <a><b>Via</b></a>.. I gave the setting to <a><b>16 mill</b></a> because in tracing I am

        <p><a><b>Auto-routing</b></a> is a tool that helps to generate the traces automatically by using mathematical functions. The autorouter is a useful tool that creates many routing variations for the current component placement. However, it is
          not a complete replacement for the manually routing method. It can help you in specific situations to augment your abilities, not replace them. (<a><b>link!</b></a>). Open the auto-routing path for generating traces automatically.</p>

        <img src="images/week7/process/14b.png" alt="">

<li><a><b>Bottom</b></a> - If you are not using <a><b>Two side pcb</b></a> Keep it two none.</li>
<li><a><b>Number of threads</b></a> - how many threads of the CPU you want the autorouter to use? This surely will affect the time it takes to finish. <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-does-2-core-4-threads-mean-in-a-cpu-I-am-talking-about-this-cpu-ARK-Intel%C2%AE-Core%E2%84%A2-i5-520M-Processor-3M-Cache-2-40-GHz" target="_blank"><b>Click here</b></a> to know more.</li></code>

        <p class="step">Note :</p>
        <p>
          If you are not getting 100% you can place the components on a different location to generate 100% Routing, for that you have to remove old generated traces, you can write the "<a><b>ripup;</b></a>" command on the command line.

          To see the Microcontroller's action on the LED I Decided to make one relation between the Switch and the LED.<br /><br />

          Code with the Switch. Since I put the Switch to the PA3(<a><b>Arduino pin 3</b></a>) and LED to the PA2(<a><b>Arduino pin 2</b></a>) in general I have written a code that tells the microcontroller to control the led blinking when I am pushing the button. <a href="images/week7/process/blinkcode.ino" target="_blank" download><b>Code link</b></a>. here I am giving power
          throught the <a><b>FTDI</b></a>.<br /><br />
          I wrote the code to tell the microcontroller that if the Switch pin is low then let led blink faster, and if the switch pin is High then slow the blink rate of led, I am controlling the blink with <a><b>delay()</b></a> function.

What I learned this week is the only way to learn electronics is to do it over and over again. Here failure of the circuit is a normal thing, It doesn't matter how many time you give to orient the board diagram and design the schematic if the led didn't blink or the microcontroller got hot after plugin you probably messed up something and you are lucky if you got to know what is wrong with your circuit. Still, the week was <a><b>Great</b></a>.

        <p>
          In my project, I'm working on a system which can <a><b>motivate people to dump their wastages on garbage bin instead of throwing it everywhere</b></a>. People will get points on using this dust-bins which will be stored in their <a><b>RFID
              card or tag</b></a>
          which will be given by the shopkeeper.
          Shopkeeper owns the smart bin. Points will be depend on the type ( WET / DRY ) and Amount of the garbage. Those pints can be use for getting <a><b>discount</b></a> in respective shop.<br /><br>Smart bin system can also be used in
          <a><b>marketing
              purpose</b></a> as it contains speaker in controller which address people towards respective shop. Some Students also tried same concept about this situation.<a><b>The key idea is to Reward people for making people use
              Dust-bin.</b></a>
        </p>

        <h1>divided Project on two phases</h1>
        <p>
          My final project is to design an <a><b>Interactive Dustbin system</b></a>. I divided this project into <a><b>two phases</b></a>.<br /><br /> in <a><b>Phase 1</b></a> dustbin System will be able to detect the presence of the individual, will
          be able to
          open and close by itself and try to manage the garbage by measuring its quantity inside. This part I am going to do in a fab lab, if I will able to complete it earlier I will work on <a><b>Phase 2</b></a>, if not I will keep it as my final
          project.<br /><br />
          In <a><b>Phase 2</b></a>, I want to make this system for commercial application in which dustbin will be owned by the <a><b>Shopkeepers</b></a> and <a><b>for trusts who manages Historical sites</b></a>. In that model, I am thinking about a
          point system which will give points after use, and those points will give help to give discounts in nearby shops.
        </p>
        <h1>Why dividing in 2 phases ?</h1>
        <p>
          initially, my idea was to make <a><b>One commercial model</b></a>. One can check the project model on the <a href="http://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/cept/students/dhruv-prakashbhaipatel/assignments/week1" target="_blank"><b>Final project
              Concept</b></a>. There I described it on in detail.<br /><br /> The <a><b>Reason</b></a>to divide into phases is I found I may have problems regarding the <a><b>programming the system</b></a>. I know the basics in <a><b>Arduino
              C</b></a> and
          <a><b>C programming</b></a>, but for programming, the RFID module will need me more learning time, though I prepared my final board the way I can easily add the <a><b>RFID - module</b></a> so if some time left I can work on that also.
        </p>
        <h1>Who has done beforehand ?</h1>
        <p>
          There are many examples where people tried to do automation in the dustbin. in some projects, they use the <a><b>ultrasonic sensor and the servo</b></a> to make the opening open or close by detecting a disturbance. In one project one used
          <a><b>Mic with
              Arduino</b></a> and servo, it will detect the sound and open the <a><b>Opening</b></a>. he is controlling a servo with drivers.<br /><br />

          One project is very similar to what I am thinking for phase one. it includes an LCD module, Ultrasonic sensor, Infrared sensor with Arduino. They are using an <a><b>Infrared sensor</b></a> to detect the objects and an <a><b>Ultrasonic
              sensor</b></a> to measure the quantity.
          <br /><br />

        <p>
          These projects were amazing I gain a more clear perspective after watching these videos, But these are personal projects and done for only a short demonstration of the system, not for public use. <a><b> What I want to implement here
            </b></a>
          is I want to modify this system for Public use, People will not use/buy it if it is not looking good enough or <a><b>it not reliable</b></a>, and manufacturers will not manufacture if it is not <a><b>convenient for sale or convenient for
              make</b></a>.
        </p>
        <h1>What will I design?</h1>
        <p>
          As I mentioned above I wanted to make one system that is complete or semi-Automated. For <a><b>phase one</b></a> I am making it complete Automated, this Ultrasonic sensor will detect for disturbance or object continuously, <a><b>When it
              will
              detect objects in between some distance it will trigger the Motor to open the dustbin.</b></a>.<br /><br />
          For phase - 2 I will like to make it semi-automatic. I will not give power continuously to the Ultrasonic instead I will add one push button for the people so system can start, it is more convient udea for me for the commercial use.

        <h1>Initial designs</h1>

            The below image was the first picture of what I wanted to make in the final project. I wanted to make <a><b>wireless communication</b></a> between the dustbin and the main controller. if someone pushes the button dust bin will open, after
            throwing the trash bin will give points using the <a><b>RFID - mmodule</b></a>.

            the

          <h1>Some research in joineries</h1>
          <p>
            Apart from renders I started thinking about how my real dustbin will look like and how its joinery will be I wanted to do try some wood joinery on the dustbin especially <a><b>Japanese joineries</b></a>, I started doing some research one
            wood dustbins and possible joints I can use in the project.
            <br /><br />
            In the beginning, I went for standard joinery which is used in the woods. below are some examples!
          </p>

          <h1>Butt joints</h1>
          <div class="print">
            <div class="print-compo">
              <div class="print-compo-images">

                <img src="images/finalproject/1.jpg">
              </div>
              <p>
                These are just two pieces of wood attached perpendicularly to each other, often with nails or screws. They can be perfectly good joints but will have no structural integrity on their own.<br /><br />
                Butt joints can be your go-to when the work is rough or rustic or when speed matters more than looks. Just make sure your joining technique is right for the job (you might also need a <a><b>metal corner bracket</b></a> for extra
                strength, for instance). To dress up a butt joint you can either countersink or plug your nail/screw holes.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <h1>Biscuit screws</h1>
          <div class="print">
            <div class="print-compo">
              <div class="print-compo-images">
                <img src="images/finalproject/4.jpg">
              </div>
              <p>
                This method involves gluing wooden “biscuits” into slots cut into the wood. It's an excellent way to hold together pieces of plywood or other engineered material, providing plenty of gluing surface as well as the strength of the
                biscuits themselves.<br /><br />

                Biscuits are good for casework and for reinforcing and lining up edge joints, but layout can be confusing until you get the hang of it.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h1>Miter joints</h1>
          <div class="print">
            <div class="print-compo">
              <div class="print-compo-images">
                <img src="images/finalproject/2.jpg">
              </div>

              <p>
                I'm including miters here because on their own they are only as strong as the glue holding them together. They have more glue surface than a straight butt joint — a plus. But the joint is still end grain, which is notorious for not
                taking glue well.<br /><br />

                Thanks to the super strength of new glues, a small box made only with miters will usually hold just fine. Still, adding a spline is a good idea.<br /><br />

                Miters with splines look nice, so the joint itself can add to the design. The biggest negative is weakness. You will also need to take extra time to set the joint up properly so it has no gaps.

                This a good example of a ‘finger’ or ‘comb’ joint. It is ideal for box constructions and is suitable for use with natural woods such as pine and mahogany or even manmade boards such as plywood and MDF. The joint is strong especially
                when used with a good quality glue such as PVA (woodworkers adhesive).<br /><br />

                If the joint is cut accurately the ‘fingers should fit together without any gaps and the glue ensures that they are virtually indestructible. They are used for a wide range of products including jeweler boxes, cabinet construction,
                kitchen cupboards and many others. (Example below - a box containing an electronic game for a young child - notice the finger joints).

            time, I knew it may have some solution but as a time constraints, I went for a less promising solution.

          <h1>RFID and PLX-DAQ</h1>
          <p>
            I Prepared the code to get the data of the RFID tag but it should be represented in the shopkeeper's Database for the point system, I was finding that solution with code and I <a><b>Got one</b></a> I used the <a
              href="https://www.parallax.com/downloads/plx-daq" target="_blank"><b>PLX-DAQ</b></a> interface which takes data via <a><b>COM ports</b></a> by which any Serial Data Transfer device is connected and Arranges it on Columns of the Excel
            sheet!
            <br /><br />I <a><b>Suggest one</b></a> to download PLX-DAQ <a href="https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=437398.msg3013761#msg3013761" target="_blank"><b>version 2</b></a>. first version has limited com ports so the option for needed
            com port may not be there, in the second one, one can write com ports number! In my case, I needed <a><b>wireless</b></a> device and it should be easily connected with Computers I choose Bluetooth for That!
          </p>
          <br />

            <ul>
              <li>
                I took the data from RFID reader
              </li>
              <li>
                Transfered it thought hardware serial (Rx, Tx)
              </li>
              <li>
                Bluetooth Transferred it to Computer PLA-DAQ interface by Selecting Com-port

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p>
            It is the last time I am typing any Conclusion regarding My weeks! I will give my Conclusion about my whole fab academy experience though! Fab academy has succeeded to give me what I wanted to do from the last <a><b>couple of
                years</b></a>. I had no making experience back so far, never new any machines even simple Jigsaw one, never used a hammer in life (little embarrassing)! in short, never done anything related to making when I started doing cad I knew I
            needed this experience I intended to design things which can help in real-world and as I told I had no product design experience of the real world. So the experience was <a><b>Great</b></a>for me!<br /><br />
            I am not saying I had always a good time in my fab academy and things worked out as I wanted to, I can't even remember things which I made it work in the first try! what I remember and being happy about are the things which I tried and
            made it happen Somehow, like a <a><b>Maker</b></a>.<br /><br />Hope I get the chance to work with Fab academy Again!

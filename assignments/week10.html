      <h3>what is molding ?</h3>
      <p>
        <a>Molding</a> or <a>molding</a> is the process of manufacturing by shaping <a>liquid</a> or <a>pliable</a> raw material using a rigid frame called a mold or matrix. This itself may have been made using a <a>pattern</a> or model of the final object.<br /><br />

A mold or mold is a hollowed-out block that is filled with a liquid or pliable material like <a>plastic, glass, metal, or ceramic raw materials</a>. The liquid hardens or sets inside the mold, adopting its shape. A mold is the counterpart to a cast. The very common bi-valve molding process uses two molds, one for each half of the object. Piece-molding uses a number of different molds, each creating a section of a complicated object. This is generally only used for larger and more valuable objects. <br /><br />

The manufacturer who makes the molds is called the mold-maker. A release agent is typically used to make removal of the hardened/set substance from the mold easier. Typical uses for molded plastics include molded furniture, molded household goods, molded cases, and structural materials.
      </p>

      <h3>What is casting ?</h3>

      Casting is a manufacturing process in which a liquid material is usually poured into a mold, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify. The solidified part is also known as a casting, which is ejected or broken out of the mold to complete the process. Casting materials are usually metals or various cold setting materials that cure after mixing two or more components together; examples are epoxy, concrete, plaster and clay. Casting is most often used for making complex shapes that would be otherwise difficult or uneconomical to make by other methods.

          step 1 : Rhinoceros
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to design something creative this time since i got chance for making the 2.5d carving on the cnc . i went for contour this time , i wanted to mold contours.
        </p>
        <img src="images/week10/design/1.jpg" alt="" />
        <p class="step">
          step 2 : design part
        </p>
        <p>
            i started thinking about design, i want to go for something which can test the 2.5d carving of my machine <a><b>shopbot</b></a>. so i go for <a><b>contours</b></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          first i created one boundary which has size of my mold to ensure my mold remained within a limits. my material block was size of 150 * 95 * 35. so i have to be within a that limits. box <a><b>needs to be</b></a> solid.
           if your outside rectangle is not solid somehow what you can do is make two rectangle and their dimensions will be according to inner and outer wall, then <a><b>Then extrude them both in solids , remember to extrude inner one laser , you will 10 mm less or as you like. then just hide the contour or other objects and use <a><b>Boolean difference</b></a> command to cut outer rectangle from inner , you will have one slot like this</b></a>. <br /><br />Other way is to just write extrude command and select both curves , <a>Select solid </a> and extrude them , in this method you have to create base by another extrude and give <a><b>Boolean union</b></a> to join the solids </p>
        </p>
        <img src="images/week10/design/2.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          <p class="step">
          contour Surface
          </p>
        i hide the outer body.
          I made one rectangle surface to <a>Generate</a> surface on the rectangle. to do it i <a><b>Divide</b></a> the surface in many parts
, i use <a><b>Rebuild</b></a> command. it will divide the surface in many spams. I divide the surface in 50 parts. with the uv points counts we can easily control the division of the surface in directions. U and v are longitudinal direction and transvers direction on any surface irrespective of the x , y and z direction.</p>
        <img sarc="images/week10/design/2a.jpg" alt="" />

        <img src="images/week10/design/2b.gif" alt="" />
        <p class="step">
          Soft edit curve
        </p>
        <p>
          This command will help to generate contour surface on the plane surface. type <a><b>soft edit surface</b></a> and select the surface. select <a><b>One point</b></a> on that and open <a><b>Four view</b></a> . Four view will help you to guide the contour. Click <a><b>control</b></a> button to reduce directions to orthogonal.
        </p>
        <img src="images/week10/design/2c.png" alt="" />
        <p class="step">
          dragging the points out
        </p>
        <p>
        you can also do that by just <a><b>Points on</b></a> command. but one problem is it will not create the smooth contours, it will generate the pointed surface that i don’t want in my design( <a> It is not bad but i don’t want it !</a>).
        </p>
        <img src="images/week10/design/2d.png" alt="" />

        <p class="step">
          final contour
        </p>
        <p>
          After a while i added my designed my final contour.
        </p>
        <img src="images/week10/design/2f1.png" alt="" />

        <p class="step">
          Extrusion
        </p>
        <p>
          Extrude the surface and don’t forget to select solid Extrusion.
        <img src="images/week10/design/2f2.png" alt="" />

        <p class="step"> fit the box inside
          </p>
          <p>
            Scaling down the model.
            i have to scale down a model to generate some extra cavity for mold , this cavity will be the walls for mold.
            <img src="images/week10/design/2f3.png" alt="" />
          </p>

          <p>
             but i wanted to give more details in contour so i edited file  and made another one i just made mold design by Boolean difference and i like the mold more as final output . so i decided to keep it. <a><b>Final design i decided to mill.</b></a>
          </p>
          <p>
            Below image is rotation of main curve. i just wanted to see how it will look like , i created this profile with proper walls below there , procedure of making wall is same.
          </p>
          <img src="images/week10/design/3.png" alt="" /><br /><br />
          <p>
             i made profile by use of <a><b>Boolean difference</b></a>.You can see below my profiles up and downs are relatively change. it can be done so easily. let me  <a><b>show</b></a> you.

             <li>
               Make a solid rectangle (<a>you can do it by making rectangle curve and then Extrusion(solid)</a>)
             </li>
             <li>
               Give Boolean difference command
             </li>
             <li>
               Profile will be upside down ! (Here i am making my previous profile with final one.)
             </li>
             <li>
               Make a border (If you want)
             </li>
             <img src="images/week10/design/4a.gif" alt="" />
            <p>
              Then i exported the file into <a><b>stl</a></b> format because i was going to use part works 3d and it supports stl formats for <a><b>3d millings</b></a>.
            </p>
            <img src="images/week10/design/4.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              <a href="images/week10/design/finalv12.stl" target="_blank download"><b>Click here</b></a> to download .stl file !
              <p class="step">
                things to be care in Exporting
              </p><a><b>Make sure the unit system in rhino should be in inches while you are exporting the file, it may not create problems for part works but my friends using modela had such problems , their model got scale up in inches.</b></a> <br /><br />if model size is 15 mm in any software and then you convert it into stl and import it for milling it may show model of <a>15 inches</a> long , means model scaled up !<br /><br /> these <a><b>Warning is for all software which export model as .stl</b></a>. For <a><b>Fusion 360</b></a> which does not support .stl model directly , export it in <a><b>step format</b></a> and then got to software like rhino or AutoCAD , change the dimensions to <a><b>inches</b></a> if they are not , and export it to <a><b>.stl</b></a> .
          </p>
          <h3>partworks3d</h3>
          <p>
            part works software can be used for generate 2d and 3d cut paths for shobbot cnc machine. part works 3D is included with all new ShopBots and will take 3D models from programs such as Rhino or from Vector/3D clip art and create Part Files (tool paths) ready for 3D machining on your ShopBot. partworks 3D allows adjusting tool paths, will create roughing passes and will machine parts from one, two or four sides as well as insert bridging.
          </p>
          <P class="step">
            Import <a><b>.stl</b></a> file
          </P>
            <p>
              as i written , in partworks3d one have to upload .stl file. <a>Refer instructions above if you haven't</a>
            </p>
          <img src="images/week10/partworks/1.png" alt="" />
          <P class="step">
            Orientate and size model
          </P>
          <p>
            In this section you can change <a><b>model size</b></a> basically you can use this settings when you are working on the big models and just testing how it will work on that scale. <br /><br />
            here you have some advantages in units , you can choose mm or inches in whatever unit you have uploaded model.
          </p>
          <img src="images/week10/partworks/2.png" alt="" />
          <P class="step">
            Material size and margins
          </P>
          <p>
            <a><b>Material size and margin</b></a> is important section , because you can ruin your design if you haven’t paid attention on directions.
            <br /><br />
            Problem is that you have to know whether your <a><b>CNC machine</b></a> and <a><b>partworks</b></a> axis are same or not , ours is not. So what happens here partworks generates cut file on the basis of length and width orientation. here it will generate different types of cut operations in longitudinal and transvers direction (<a><b>which is normal for rectangle cut files</b></a>).<br /><br /> so even if you think axis
             are the same their respective length and width are different and so  you have to rotate the workpiece to align length and width
  </p>
          <img src="images/week10/partworks/3.png" alt="" />
          <img src="images/week10/partworks/3a.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            Here one have to change the <a><b>orientation</b></a> of the work piece while putting it on cnc machine you have to rotate it to 90 degree anticlockwise.<br /><br /> place the origin on the <a><b>Top - left corner</b></a> in material size.<br /><br /> on the cnc machine you have to put zero at bottom left since materialism rotated 90 degree . see <a><b>CNC</b></a> images to understand better
          </p>
          <P class="step">
            Roughing toolpath
          </P>
          <p>
            I was going to use <a><b>1/8th end and ball nose mill for cut</b></a>.

              i will recommend to pay attention on step over parameter. it will main parameter to define horizontal error and surface finish in final cutting. <br /><br />
              <a>
                i did one mistake here , in finishing if one increase the rpm-speed and decrease the feed rate will increase the surface finish , but i did inverse. i was little concern about wax melting though.</a>
              <br /><br />
              <a>Step over is distance between two individual toolpaths, if your step over will be 100% (100% of the tool diameter) , the next tool path will be 100% away from the adjacent one. and it will leave some uncut material in between.</a>

          <h3>Group work</h3>
          The assignment was to read the safety data sheet for different casting material and make a test cast with them. As a contribution i prepared mold which is used in group work ! we tried different materials like <a href="https://www.usg.com/content/usgcom/en/products/industrial/art-statuary/drystone-casting-media.html" target="_blank"><b>Dry Stone</b></a>, <a href="https://www.usg.com/content/usgcom/en_CA_east/products/industrial/art-statuary/hydro-stone-gypsum-cement.html" target="_blank"><b>HydroStone</b></a>, <a href="https://www.smooth-on.com/products/smooth-cast-300/" target="_blank"><b>Smooth cast-300</b></a>, <a href="https://www.smooth-on.com/products/smooth-cast-305/" target="_blank"><b>Smooth cast-305</b></a>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            This week bring something new for me , i learn how can i do <a><b>3d milling</b></a> , what types of creative textures machine can do , parameters that should be taken care on the m3d milling , lately i realized i can do roughing and finishing only with one tool , by just setting stepover and feed rate.<a> lower the step over , finer finishing will be.</a><br /><br />In molding part , it was very good experience , i got to know about different materials and parameters in mold and i also want to explore it more in future.

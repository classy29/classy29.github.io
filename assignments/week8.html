        <p>In week 8 we are going to learn about Computer-controlled machining. In <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/scanning_printing/index" target="_blank"><b>week 6</b></a> we learn about the addictive manufacturing process where we make
          the product by adding the layers of the materials layer by layer. Week 8 is introducing the second manufacturing process which is the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.custompartnet.com/wu/machining"><b>Material removing process</b></a>,
          in which components are made by removing unwanted materials, metal removing processes are relatively fast.
          <br><br>
          Week 8's <a><b>Assignment</b></a> was to Make something <a><b>Big</b></a> using the <a href="https://astromachineworks.com/what-is-cnc-machining/" target="_blank"><b>CNC</b></a>.</p>
        <h1>CNC</h1>
        <p>
          CNC machining is a manufacturing process in which pre-programmed computer software dictates the movement of factory tools and machinery. The process can be used to control a range of complex machinery, from grinders and lathes to mills and
          routers. With CNC machining, three-dimensional cutting tasks can be accomplished in a single set of prompts.

        <h1>Making Of Planetary Gear</h1>
        <p>
          So Assignment Was to make Something big I decided to make a big <a><b>Planetary Gear mechanism</b></a>. I cho0se Planetary gear because I want to know how I can use different parameters to make perfect rotating pairs of gears. Gears have so
          many <a><b>parameters</b></a> and they should be accurate in the process of making to have working gears.
        </p>
        <p>A planetary gearbox is a gearbox with the input shaft and the output shaft aligned. A planetary gearbox is used to transfer the largest torque in the most compact form. <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Gears"><b>Click here</b></a>
          to know different types of gears.

        <h1>Gear Terminology</h1>
        <p class="step">Law of gearing</p>
        <p>
          The angular velocity ratio of all gears of a meshed gear system must remain constant also the common normal at the point of contact must pass through the pitch point.
          <br />
          <br />
          If <a><b>w1</b></a> and <a><b>w2</b></a> are the angular velocities and <a><b>D1</b></a> and <a><b>D2</b></a> are Diameters of two gears meshed together then w1/w2 = D2/d1 should satisfy. Pitch point - the point of contact of the pitch
          lines of two gears or of a rack and pinion when in the mesh.<a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Gears" target="_blank"><b>Click here</b></a> to know in details about gear types and Terminology.
          <br /><br />
          Basically, Every parameter is connected to each other and that’s why we don’t have to keep track of every parameter, instead we need only values of <a><b>Module of gear</b></a>, <a><b>Gear ration</b></a>, <a><b>pitch diameter</b></a>,
          <a><b>Pitch circle</b></a>, <a><b>Backlash</b></a>, <a><b>Diametral pith</b></a>.
        </p>
        <p class="step">Module of gear</p>
        <p>
          The module of gear determines the size of the teeth in the gear.
          <br /><br />
          The module of gear determines the size of the teeth in the gear.
          "Module" is the unit of size that indicates how big or small a gear is. It is the ratio of the reference diameter of the gear divided by the number of teeth.<br /><br />

          Thus, <a><b>m</b></a>=D/Z.<br /><br />
          <a><b>D</b></a> is the Reference diameter of gear(Pith Diameter).<br />
          <a><b>Z</b></a>is the number of Teeth.<br />
          <br />
          It describes the relationship between the pitch diameter and the Number of teeth on the gear.<a><b> For meshing of Two gears Modules of two gears should be same , otherwise law of gearing will not satisfy</a></b>.
        </p>
        <p class="step"> reference Diameter(pitch Diameter)</p>
        <p>
          It is equal to the circumference divided by
          Circumference the number of teeth.
          <br /><br />
          <a><b> Circumference Pitch </b></a>= Circumference(pi* D(Pith Diameter)) / Number of teeth.<br /><br />
          It defines the distance between two points of adjacent teeth located at the same location on each teeth. <a

        </p>
        <p class="step">Pitch circle</p>
        <p>
          An imaginary circle passing through the teeth of a gearwheel, concentric with the gearwheel, and having a radius that would enable it to be in contact with a similar circle around a mating gearwheel.
        </p>
        <p class="step">Gear Ratio</p>
        <p>
          Gear Ratio expresses the relationship between a Driving Gear (the gear connected to the input power source, such as a motor) and a Driven Gear (the gear connected to the output, such as a wheel or mechanism) in a system.
          <br /><br />
          Gear ratio is a very important parameter that determines the Applications of the gears, Output speed, Number of Teeth in individual gears.
        </p><br />
        <div class="listp">
          <ul>
            <li>
              When you have a system with a Driving Gear that is SMALLER than the Driven Gear you will increase Torque and decrease Speed.
            </li>
            <li>
              When you have a system with a Driving Gear that is LARGER than the Driven Gear you will increase Speed and decrease Torque
            </li>
          </ul>

        </p>


        <p class="step">Backlash</p>
        <p>
          Backlash, a clearance between mating gear teeth, is built into speed reducers to let the gears mesh without binding and to provide space for a film of lubricating oil between the teeth. This prevents overheating and tooth damage.
        </p>
        <p class="step">Diametral Pitch</p>
        <p>
          It is defined as the number of teeth per inch of the diameter of the pitch circle of gear.
        </p>

          <h1> Gear Design in AutoCAD</h1>
          <p>
            I started designing gears in AutoCAD, since I was going to use <a><b>3rd party software</b></a>to design the gears I was just focusing on the <a><b>pitch diameter</b></a> only.<br /><br />
            I want to make parametric relations between the circles because I was intended to make one prototype first.

            Pitch circles of planetary gear
          </p>
          <p>
            I started with pitch circles because it makes it easy to predict mesh between the gears.

          <p>
            I wanted to try this concept, I was not sure working of it, but I created one sketch anyway.
            For making these types of designs you should have knowledge of <a><b>Constrains</b></a> and <a

          <p class="step">
            Paramtric relation
          </p>
          <p>
            <a><b>The reason</b></a> I want to design in parametric is, I can do much faster iterations on my design, I was working with it first time and I know <a><b>In prototyping</b></a> I will have some kerfing problems. I was also not sure
            about dimensional tolerance in CNC in the real model, I thought it will take many experiments.
            <br /><br />
            I set dimensions of the pitch circle the way it will give <a><b>gear reduction</b></a> of 3, in which the output shaft will rotate one-third of the input shaft.
            <br /><br />
            <a><b>Image below</b></a> describes the Gear ratio/ gear reduction relations between the radius of sun gear (s) and the Ring gear (r). Here I am repeatedly talking about gear reduction because Planetary gear is known to reduce the output
            shaft speed to increase the torque in drive applications in a compact size, we can also increase the speed to third by taking input as a ring here.

            This picture shows the parametric relation between gears and ring, my main parameter here is <a><b>Sun gear Diameter</b></a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here I kept sun gear Diameter <a><b>60 mm</b></a> for the prototype. It changes the planet and ring gear diameter accordingly. <a><b>a</b></a> is the Diameter for Shafts or Wooden dowels (On Axle).

          <h1>3d Modeling in fusion 360</h1>
          <p>
            After Finalizing my parameters I have to design the cad model for the proper way of understanding in joining and frame of Gear assembly. Since it was a critical and time-consuming part to make my own teeth design I decided to take the
            help of software or plugins.

            All links are great for gear design but I choose the FM gear plugin for fusion360, reasons were they have some design limits or their full versions are paid or they do not support internal gear type. fusion360 has also a Plugin for gear
            but only supports spur gears not internal.

          <p>
            These are the parameter You can give on the FM module, Everything else will be controlled by the inter-relations of parameters then. I kept the <a><b>Unit</b></a> system to standard <a><b>Metric</b></a> because I am not familiar with the
            English parameter.

            <br /><br /><a><b>Pressure angle: </b></a> I kept the pressure angle <a><b>20 degree</b></a> here. there are three standard pressure angles <a><b>14.5</b></a>, <a><b>20</b></a>.<a><b>25</b></a>.
          <pre>
<code>
Pressure angle: Pressure angle in relation to gear teeth, also known as the angle of obliquity, is the angle between the tooth face and the gear wheel tangent. It is more precisely the angle at a pitch point between the line of pressure (which is normal to the tooth surface) and the plane tangent to the pitch surface. The pressure angle gives the direction normal to the tooth profile.

<a>Lower the pressure angle higher will be power transmission( in terms of pressure angle). But higher pressure angle will give good loading ability(Torque) and increase the stress as well.</a>
</code>
</pre>
          <p>
            Since I have an application of torque and I did not want my teeth to break I kept it to 20 degrees.
            <br /><br />
            Here <a><b>module</b></a> will take control of the number of teeth, the higher the module laser the number of teeth. but I should be kept at an optimum value to have smooth power transmission. I kept <a><b>Module: 2</b></a>.

            <pre>
<code><a>First one</a> :

I gave dimensions same as mdf sheet to test. (0.5 mm additional).

<li>Sun gear : 60.5 mm</li>
<li>planet gear : 30.5 mm</li>
<li>Ring gear : 119.5 mm</li></code>
</pre>
            <p>
              I knew it might work because it was designed for MDF but I want to know how much it loses. I found it was spacing <a><b>1.5 mm</b></a> on one side. for the component that I directly added <a><b>1 mm</b></a> in sun and planet and
              decrease the same from the ring.
            </p>
            <pre>

<li>planet gear : 31 mm</li>
<li>Ring gear : 119 mm</li></code>

              And it was a <a><b>bad idea</b></a>, now <a>Ring gear</a>, now Ring gear was small for sun and planet to assemble, I hardly placed planet in assembly but it will surely break if I try to force it in more then a few times. so my two
              models fail. but I found one solution though. I <a><b>Checked</b></a> if I took sun and planet of <a><b>version 1</b></a> and ring of <a><b>version 2</b></a> I was giving perfect result. not too tight not too loose.

              <p>
                After knowing the <a><b>pitch diameter</b></a> I generated a gear profile on fusion-360. <a><b>The process of generating</b></a> the gear profile is the same as I mentioned above in <a><b>prototyping</b></a>. after generating profiles
                and manual
                check on the cad I generated <a><b>DXF files</b></a> for each type of gear.
                <br /><br />
                Here I didn't generate the inner diameter of gears, that part I can do in Autodesk after generating <a><b>.DXF</b></a> files.</p>

              <p>
                After then I arranged profiles according to the sheet. The reason I pit small holes around profiles is for screws, I <a><b>noticed</b></a> in CNC we spent much time in mounting the sheet and it is a tedious job, sometimes we need to
                mount screws in between the sheets. but the main problem is screws can be in way of our toolpath and we never know exactly how far it is from the main tool path, I saw some screws are cut from the tool so far.<br /><br />


                So the solution I came with is to use <a><b>Pockets</b></a>. I was going to cut Pockets in a sheet of <a><b>1 or 2 mm</b></a> and place the screws there. so I can have a perfect location where can I put the screws and the main
                advantage is if I have to change the location of the profile I will know where to put the new profile exactly.

                <br /><br /> One can <a><b>Download</b></a> the CNC bed file from the sidebar.

                In the lab, I found we have one sheet which I can use for my <a><b>sun</b></a>, <a><b>ring</b></a> and <a><b>axle</b></a> and it will help me to know about cutting clearance, if I have to give the component the kerf or not. so I went
                to cut these three profiles. after making these cutting files separate I went for a cut on CNC.

                There is a small issue between our CNC and partworks software, they have a different orientation. Axis orientation differs by <a><b>90 degree anticlockwise</b></a>.<br /><br />
                In our CNC,</p>
              <pre>X axis - <a><b>Width</b></a> : 1200 mm
</pre>
              <pre>Y axis - <a><b>Length</b></a> : 2400 mm
</pre><br />
              <p>
                But since axis orientation is different in CNC and the partworks I have to interchange the values of <a><b>Width</b></a> and <a><b>Length</b></a> because they are differ by <a><b>90 degrees anticlock</b></a>.

                First try full assembly
              </p>
              <p>
                Oops !!! Sun gear is not able to hold its place in a vertical position, it was my design fault I think, I should have to take care of back support in sun gears, I tried it on the Horizontal position Anyway.

                Sub assembly working
              </p>
              <p>
                I was very happy it was quite smooth but I don't know where it is h=giving problems! even the sub-assembly of planet gear and ring gear was quite smooth but when I integrate them it became too tight to rotate and sun gear can t handle
                that thrust for a long time. <a><b> But it was rotating though, below is the video.</b></a>

                Full assembly Second try
              </p>

              <p>
                But I enjoyed it from the start to the end! The end results were not as quiet as expected though but it helped me to develop some maker skills to use different tools and though how you can do things step by step! At this movement, Our
                <a><b>Two
                    instructers</b></a> and the whole team were helping me to make this thing work for me! It was a very good experience, <a><b>appreciated</b></a> ! <br /><br />

              <h1>Group work</h1>
              <p>

                In computer cutting group work we as a group was going to try a different speed and feed rate on <a><b>MDF and Plywood</b></a> so we can have a conclusion in which speed and feed are giving better surface finish.<bR /><br />
                my role was to handle the machining process in group work, I and Samiul were trying different speeds and feed on the materials and checking cutting behaviors! Click here to redirect on the group <a

              <h1>conclusion</h1>
              <p>
                As I mentioned above <a><b>CNC week</b></a> was amazing from start to end. it gave me a feeling of being a maker which was one of the main reasons I wanted to Do fab academy!
                <br /><br />In CNC week I learned much more about <a><b>laser cutting moving assembly</b></a>, <a><b>Partworks software</b></a>, <a><b>Shopbot</b></a> and very much new to me how to <a><b>assemble things</b></a>. The last was not
                perfect though. Still, a week was great!

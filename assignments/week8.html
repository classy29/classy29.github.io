        <p> In week 8 we are going to learn about Computer controlled machining. In <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/scanning_printing/index.html" target="_blank"><b>week 6</b></a> we learn about addictive manufacturing process where we
          make the product by adding the layers of the materials layer by layer. Week 8 is introducing second manufacturing process which is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.custompartnet.com/wu/machining"><b>Material removing process</b></a>, in
          which components are made by removing unwanted materials, metal removing processes are relatively fast.
          <br><br>
          Week 8's <a><b>Assignment</b></a> was to Make something <a><b>Big</b></a> using the <a href="https://astromachineworks.com/what-is-cnc-machining/" target="_blank"><b>CNC</b></a>.</p>
        <h3>CNC</h3>
        <p>
          CNC machining is a manufacturing process in which pre-programmed computer software dictates the movement of factory tools and machinery. The process can be used to control a range of complex machinery, from grinders and lathes to mills and
          routers. With CNC machining, three-dimensional cutting tasks can be accomplished in a single set of prompts.

        <h3>Making Of Planetary Gear</h3>
        <p>
          So Assignment Was to make Something big i decided to make big <a><b>Planetary Gear mechanism</b></a>. I cho0se Planetary gear because i want to know how i can use different parameters to make perfect rotating pairs of gears. Gears have so
          many <a><b>parameters</b></a> and they should be accurate in the process of making to have working gears.<br /><br />
          <p>
            <a>A planetary gearbox is a gearbox with the input shaft and the output shaft aligned. A planetary gearbox is used to transfer the largest torque in the most compact form </a>

        <h3>Gear Terminology</h3>
        <h4>Law of gearing</h4>
        <p>
          the angular velocity ratio of all gears of a meshed gear system must remain constant
          also the common normal at the point of contact must pass through the pitch point.<br />
          <br />
          if <a><b>w1</b></a> and <a><b>w2</b></a> are the angular velocities and <a><b>D1</b></a> and <a><b>D2</b></a> are Diameters of two gears meshed together then w1/w2 = D2/d1 should satisfy.
          Pitch point - the point of contact of the pitch lines of two gears or of a rack and pinion when in mesh.
          <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Gears" target="_blank"><b>click here</b></a> to know in details about gear types and Terminology
        </p>
        Basically, Every parameters are connected to each other and that’s why we don’t have to keep track of every parameters, instead we need only values of <a>Module of gear</a>, <a>Gear ration</a>, <a>pitch diameter</a>,<a>Pitch circle</a>,
        <a>Backlash</a>, <a>Diametral pith</a>
        <h4>Module of gear</h4>
        <p>
          Module of gear determines the size of the teeth in the gear.<br /><br />　"Module" is the unit of size that indicates how big or small a gear is. It is the ratio of the
          reference diameter of the gear divided by the number of teeth.<br />
          Thus <a><b>m</b></a>=D/Z<br />
          <a><b>D</b></a> is Reference diameter of gear(Pith Diameter)<br />
          <a><b>Z</b></a> is number of Teeth<br />
          <br />
          It describes the the relation between the pitch diameter and the Number of teeth on the gear.<a> For meshing of Two gears Modules of two gears should be same , otherwise law of gearing will not satisfy.</a></p>
        <h4> reference Diameter(pitch Diameter)</h4>
        <p>
          It is equal to the circumference divided by
          Circumference the number of teeth.
          <br />
          <a><b> Circumference Pitch </b></a>= Circumference(pi* D(Pith Diameter)) / Number of teeth.<br /><br />
          It defines distance between two points of adjacent teeth located at same location on each teeth.
          <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.09/people/cranor/How_to_Make_(Almost)_Anything/David_Cranor/Entries/2009/10/12_Entry_1_files/module.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Click here</b></a> to know more.
        </p>
        <h4>Pitch circle</h4>
        <p>
          an imaginary circle passing through the teeth of a gearwheel, concentric with the gearwheel, and having a radius that would enable it to be in contact with a similar circle around a mating gearwheel
        </p>
        <h4>Gear Ratio</h4>
        <p>
          Gear Ratio expresses the relationship between a Driving Gear (the gear connected to the input power source, such as a motor) and a Driven Gear (the gear connected to the output, such as a wheel or mechanism) in a system.
          <img src="images/week8/terms/gearratio.png" alt=""><br /><br />
          Gear ratio is very important parameter that determines the Applications of the gears , Output speed , Number of Teeth in individual gears.<br />
          <b>When you have a system with a Driving Gear that is SMALLER than the Driven Gear you will increase Torque and decrease Speed.
          </b><br />
          <b>When you have a system with a Driving Gear that is LARGER than the Driven Gear you will increase Speed and decrease Torque:<br /><br />

          </b>
          <a href="https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexiq/education/iq-curriculum/mechanisms/gear-ratio" target="_blank"><b>Click Here</b></a> To know more about gear ratio.
          <h4>Backlash</h4>
          <p>
            Backlash, a clearance between mating gear teeth, is built into speed reducers to let the gears mesh without binding and to provide space for a film of lubricating oil between the teeth. This prevents overheating and tooth damage.
          </p>
          <h4>Diametral Pitch</h4>
          <p>It is defined as the number of tooth per inch of the diameter of the pitch circle of a gear..

          <h3> Gear Design in AutoCAD</h3>
          <p>
            I started designing gears in AutoCAD , since i was going to use <a><b>3rd party software</b></a> to design the gears i was just focusing on the <a>pitch diameter</a> only.<br /><br />
            I want to make parametric relations between the circles because i was intended to make one prototype first.
          </p>
          <p class="step">
            Pitch circles of planetary gear
          </p>
          <p>
            i started with pitch circles, because it makes easy to predict mesh between the gears.

            Multi-ring gear
          </p>
          <p>
            i wanted to try this concept, i was not sure working of it , but i created one sketch anyway.<br />For making these types of designs you should have knowledge of <a><b>Constrains</b></a> and <a

          <p class="step">
            Paramtric relation
          </p>
          <p>
            <a>Reason</a> i want to design in parametric is , i can do much faster iterations on my design , i was working with first time and i know <a><b>In prototyping</b></a> i will have some kerfing problems. i was also not sure about
            dimensional tolerance in cnc in real model , i though it will take much experiments so stick with it.<br /><br />
            For giving parametric relations i liked to <a><b>remove</b></a> extra <a><b>Circles</b></a> from design , it can be generated from <a><b>Array polar</b></a> command later on.
            <br /><br />I set dimensions of <a>pitch circle</a> the way it will give gear reduction<a><b>gear reduction</b></a> of 3 , in which <a>the output shaft will rotate one third of input shaft</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a>Image below describes the Gear ratio/ gear reduction relations between the radius of sun gear (s) and the Ring gear (r) . Here i am repeatedly talking about gear reduction because Planetary gear are known to reduce the output shaft
              speed to increase the torque in drive applications in compact size, we can also increase the speed to third by taking input as a ring here.</a>

          </p>
          <p>
            Here i kept sun gear Diameter <a><b>60 mm</b></a> for prototype. It changes the planet and ring gear diameter according. <a><b>a</b></a> is Diameter for Shafts or Wooden dowels (On Axle)

          <h3>3d Modeling in fusion 360</h3>
          <p>
            After Finalizing my parameters i have to design the cad model for proper way of understanding in joining and frame of Gear assembly. Since it was critical and time consuming part to make my own teeth design i decided to take help of
            software or plugins.
            <br /><br />
            <h4>I found good web pages and software which can help in gear design.</h4>

              </a>
            </li><br />

            All links are great for gear design but i choose FM gear plug in for fusion360 , reasons were they have some design limits or their full versions are paid or they do not support internal gear type.
            fusion360 has also Plug in for gear but only supports spur gears not internal.
          </p>
          <p class="step">
            FM gear plugins
            <p>
            so, I used plug in for the fusion360 "<a https://apps.autodesk.com/FUSION/en/Detail/Index?id=6294804001663532834&appLang=en&os=Win64> <b>FM gears</b></a>" for generating gears.
              <br />To run the script go to the "<a><b>Add-ins and script</b></a>" in fusion 360 and ad FM gears , Then open the FM gears from <a><b>create menu</b></a>.

            These are the parameter You can give on FM module , Everything else will be controlled by inter-relations of parameters then. I kept <a><b>Unit</b></a> system to standard <a><b>Metric</b></a>, because i am not familiar with English parameter.

            <br /><br /><a><b>Pressure angle :</b></a> i kept pressure angle <a><b>20 degree</b></a> here. there ae three standard pressure angles <a><b>14.5</b></a>, <a><b>20</b></a>. <a><b>25</b></a>.
<pre>
<code>
Pressure angle : Pressure angle in relation to gear teeth, also known as the angle of obliquity, is the angle between the tooth face and the gear wheel tangent. It is more precisely the angle at a pitch point between the line of pressure (which is normal to the tooth surface) and the plane tangent to the pitch surface. The pressure angle gives the direction normal to the tooth profile.
</code>
</pre>
<p>
  <a>Lower the pressure angle higher will be power transmission( in terms of pressure angle). But higher pressure angle will give good loading ability(Torque)  and increase the stress as well.</a>
              Since i have a application of torque and i did not want my teeth to break i kept it to 20 degree.
<br /><br />
  Here <a><b>module</b></a> will take control of number of teeth ,  higher the module laser the number of teeth. but i should be kept at optimum value to have smooth power transmission. i kept <a><b>Module : 2 </b></a>.

            Finalizing Perfect diameter</p>
            <p>
              i have to make 3 prototype cuts for my design.
<pre>
<code>
<a>First one</a> : I gave dimensions same as mdf sheet to test. (0.5 mm additional)

<li>Sun gear : 60.5 mm</li>
<li>planet gear : 30.5 mm</li>
<li>Ring gear : 119.5 mm</li>
</code>
</pre>
            i knew it might work because it was design for mdf but i want to know how much it looses. i found it was spacing <a><b>1.5 mm</b></a> on one side.
               for component that i directly added <a><b>1 mm</b></a> in sun and planet and decrease same from ring.<br /><br />
<pre>
<code>
<a>second one</a> : (1 mm additional)

<li>Sun gear : 61 mm</li>
<li>planet gear : 31 mm</li>
<li>Ring gear : 119 mm</li>
</code>
</pre>
            And it was <a><b>bad idea</b></a>, now  <a>Ring gear</a> was small for sun and planet to assemble, i hardly placed planet in assembly but it will surely break if i try to force it in more then few times. so my two models fail. but i found one solution though. I <a><b>Checked</b></a> if i took sun and planet of <a><b>version 1</b></a> and ring of <a><b>version 2</b></a>  i was giving perfect result. not too tight not too loose.
            </p>
<pre>
<code>
<a>Third one</a> :

<li>Sun gear : 60.5 mm</li>
<li>planet gear : 30.5 mm</li>
<li>Ring gear : 119 mm</li>
</code>
</pre>
<p>
  It worked , i was marking every version so did not get confuse on them. <a><b>Then</b></a> i made three sets of dimensions of last one to glue them and made one frame to support ring gear.

           i get to learn during prototype making, it clear my idea half way i also found which things i should <a><b>take care</b></a> in my final design for example
        </p>
         <li>
           i forgot to make clearance gap between frame and inner ring, thought i made some clearance in my cad model i forgot to make it on model.
         </li>
         <li>
             i have to think about some wood dowel or metal rode which can carry the planet gear because in big model it will be some load Constrains.
         </li>
         <li>
           and for output shaft, i am going to place one disk and want to do some 2.5 d carving on it with <a>CNC</a></li>

       <p>
         After analysing the <a><b>Prototype</b></a> i started working on my <a><b>CNC model</b></a>.<br /><br />
         For CNC models i wanted to use this materials efficiently , and instead of two axles <a><b>back and forth</b></a> of the Gear assembly i decided to use only one axle. it will definitely help me save the material and i can use it for another CNC work.

My CNC file is also parametric. so i can have good flexibility in design changes. <a>Below is the Parameters and its relations i gave on Desing</a>. design procedure is same as i <a><b>explained</b></a> in prototype file. Here i used pitch circles as references , according to it i am going to generate gear profiles.

           <br /><br />
           I want to cut output disk later , if sun and ring gear will work perfect after assembly and able to such load after i will cut it , reason i put disk there is to make sure of some space.

           So for planet gears i have to decide the inner diameter , i have bearing diameter(outer) of <a><b>47 mm</b></a>. so i have to check which inner diameter of planet gear will be good. since i have to check for holder also i did some experiment cuts to know which dimensions will be good for assembly, since <a><b>Dowels</b></a> are tapers , i cant have exact idea which dimension will work properly.
           <br /><br /> so i cut some and found exact one , i generated gcode file on <a href="http://www.shopbottools.com/mProducts/software.htm" target="_blank"><b>partworks 3.5</b></a>. I uploaded about generating the g code in planet gear cutting section.

           <br /><br />

           So solution i came with is use <a><b>Pockets</b></a>. i was going to cut Pockets in sheet of <a><b>1 or 2 mm</b></a> and place the screws there. so i can have perfect location where can i put the screws and main avantage is if i have to change the location of profile i will know where to put new profile exatly.

             In part works before importing the sketch , we have to give <a><b>Bad size - cutting sheet size</b></a>. to do that <a><b>click</b></a> creat new file.

         </p>
         <p>
           <a>There is a small issue between our CNC and partworks software , they have different orientation. axis orientation differ by <a><b>90 degree anticlock wise</b></a></a><br /><br />
           in Our CNC
          <li>
            X axis - <a><b>Width</b></a> : 1200 mm
          </li>
          <li>
            Y axis - <a><b>Length</b></a> : 2400 mm
          </li><br /><br />
           But since axis orientation is different in CNC and the partworks i have to interchange the values of <a><b>Width</b></a> and <a><b>Length</b></a> because they are differ by <a><b>90 degrees anticlock</b></a>.<br /><br />
           In Partworks

           <li>
             X axis - <a><b>Lenth</b></a> : 2400 mm
           </li>
           <li>
             Y axis - <a><b>Width</b></a>: 1200 mm
           </li>
           <li>
             Material thickness : 12 mm
           </li>
           <li>
             Units : mm , <a>Units should be same with the software you exported files, otherwise it will scale up or scale down according to mm and inch scale.</a>
           </li>

</li>
<li>Edit vectors : <a> It is use to modify the curves , bottom part of the section is for joining curves , suppouse curves are not joined , it will join the curves, if curve is not joined machine will cut that line and arc as a individual curve and it may cause problems.

<li>Align objects : it will align objects

<li>Layers :It can help to orient the design files and separate two tryess of different operations.

<pre>
<code>
<li>Pass Depth : Pass depth determines in how many phashes you want to cut the material.<br /><br />

If i Put directly 12 mm here , it will go straigh <a><b>12 mm</b></a> down. it is not advisable beacause tool will face very high forces than , so i decided to give 3 mm passes. each time tool will go 3 mm down after completing one cutting cycle and my material will be cut in 4 phashe(12/3).<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Spindle speed : it determines <a><b>RPM</b></a> of the Spindle.
</li>
<li>Feed rate : it determines <a><b>Feeding Force</b></a> applied on material.

<li>Feed rate : it determines <a><b>Feeding Force</b></a> applied on material.

<li>Plunge Rate : Plunge rate is the speed at which the router bit is driven down into the material when starting a cut. if is too <a><b>High</b></a> it will break the tool or make crack on surface of material.

           i thougth this bis beacause of speed  so i reduced it but no help from that , i think tool diameter is too much for teeth profile and thats wht it burning the sheet by slowing down at edges. <a><b>Then i tried 2 flute spiral bit 3 mm bit</b></a>.

           Starting from Frames

         <p>
           I had different options in Fabrications
           <li>
             Could use Buiscuit joinery by making slots in frame
           </li>
           <li>
             Use of glue for permanent fix
           </li>
           <li>
             Use of Nails for Fast assembly and disassembly
           </li>

           <p>
             <a><b>Using buiscuit type joinery</b></a> : it would be good if i could use Buiscuit type joinery and i intended to do that , but two frames should be concentric for that if not they will misalign and i will not able to fit my planetry assembly. i needed something which is good to change the joints position if frames cant be align.
           </p>
           <p>
             <a><b>Using Glue : </b></a> Glue would be permanent solution , if i kept little bit misalignment it cant be fixable
           </p>
           <p>
             <a><b>Use of nails :</b></a> for my case it was solution  , i could realign if theres a some error in misalignment, it is easy to add and remove also. ao i choose nails

      <p>
        In computer cutting group work we as a group were going to try different speed and feed rate on <a><b>MDF</b></a> and <a><b>Plywood</b></a> so we can have conclusion which speed and feed is giving better surface finish. <bR /><br />
        my role was to handle the machining process in group work , Me and <a><b>Samiul</b></a> were trying differentspeeds and feed on the materials andd checking cutting behaviours !

      <h3>conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        As i mentioned above <a><b>CNC week</b></a> was amazing from start to end. it gave me feeling of being maker which was one of the main reason i wanted to Do fab academy !
        <br /><br />In CNC week i learned much more about <a>laser cutting moving assembly</a> , <a>Part works software</a> , <a>SHopbot</a> and very much new to me how to <a>assemble things</a>. last was not perfect though. Still week was great !

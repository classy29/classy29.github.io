        <p>In week 8 we are going to learn about Computer-controlled machining. In <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/scanning_printing/index" target="_blank"><b>week 6</b></a> we learn about the addictive manufacturing process where we make the product by adding the layers of the materials layer by layer. Week 8 is introducing the second manufacturing process which is the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.custompartnet.com/wu/machining"><b>Material removing process</b></a>, in which components are made by removing unwanted materials, metal removing processes are relatively fast.
          <br><br>
          Week 8's <a><b>Assignment</b></a> was to Make something <a><b>Big</b></a> using the <a href="https://astromachineworks.com/what-is-cnc-machining/" target="_blank"><b>CNC</b></a>.</p>
        <h1>CNC</h1>
        <p>
          CNC machining is a manufacturing process in which pre-programmed computer software dictates the movement of factory tools and machinery. The process can be used to control a range of complex machinery, from grinders and lathes to mills and routers. With CNC machining, three-dimensional cutting tasks can be accomplished in a single set of prompts.

        <h1>Making Of Planetary Gear</h1>
        <p>
          So Assignment Was to make Something big I decided to make a big <a><b>Planetary Gear mechanism</b></a>. I cho0se Planetary gear because I want to know how I can use different parameters to make perfect rotating pairs of gears. Gears have so many <a><b>parameters</b></a> and they should be accurate in the process of making to have working gears.
        </p>
        <p>A planetary gearbox is a gearbox with the input shaft and the output shaft aligned. A planetary gearbox is used to transfer the largest torque in the most compact form. <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Gears"><b>Click here</b></a> to know different types of gears.

        <h1>Gear Terminology</h1>
        <p class="step">Law of gearing</p>
        <p>
          The angular velocity ratio of all gears of a meshed gear system must remain constant also the common normal at the point of contact must pass through the pitch point.
          <br />
          <br />
          If <a><b>w1</b></a> and <a><b>w2</b></a> are the angular velocities and <a><b>D1</b></a> and <a><b>D2</b></a>  are Diameters of two gears meshed together then w1/w2 = D2/d1 should satisfy. Pitch point - the point of contact of the pitch lines of two gears or of a rack and pinion when in the mesh.<a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Gears" target="_blank"><b>Click here</b></a> to know in details about gear types and Terminology.
          <br /><br />
        Basically, Every parameter is connected to each other and that’s why we don’t have to keep track of every parameter, instead we need only values of <a><b>Module of gear</b></a>, <a><b>Gear ration</b></a>, <a><b>pitch diameter</b></a>, <a><b>Pitch circle</b></a>, <a><b>Backlash</b></a>, <a><b>Diametral pith</b></a>.
      </p>
        <p class="step">Module of gear</p>
        <p>
          The module of gear determines the size of the teeth in the gear.
          <br /><br />
          The module of gear determines the size of the teeth in the gear.
"Module" is the unit of size that indicates how big or small a gear is. It is the ratio of the reference diameter of the gear divided by the number of teeth.<br /><br />

          Thus, <a><b>m</b></a>=D/Z.<br /><br />
          <a><b>D</b></a> is the Reference diameter of gear(Pith Diameter).<br />
          <a><b>Z</b></a>is the number of Teeth.<br />
          <br />
          It describes the relationship between the pitch diameter and the Number of teeth on the gear.<a><b> For meshing of Two gears Modules of two gears should be same , otherwise law of gearing will not satisfy</a></b>.
        </p>
        <p class="step"> reference Diameter(pitch Diameter)</p>
        <p>
          It is equal to the circumference divided by
          Circumference the number of teeth.
          <br /><br />
          <a><b> Circumference Pitch </b></a>= Circumference(pi* D(Pith Diameter)) / Number of teeth.<br /><br />
          It defines the distance between two points of adjacent teeth located at the same location on each teeth. <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.09/people/cranor/How_to_Make_(Almost)_Anything/David_Cranor/Entries/2009/10/12_Entry_1_files/module.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Click here</b></a> to know more.
        </p>
        <p class="step">Pitch circle</p>
        <p>
          An imaginary circle passing through the teeth of a gearwheel, concentric with the gearwheel, and having a radius that would enable it to be in contact with a similar circle around a mating gearwheel.
        </p>
        <p class="step">Gear Ratio</p>
        <p>
          Gear Ratio expresses the relationship between a Driving Gear (the gear connected to the input power source, such as a motor) and a Driven Gear (the gear connected to the output, such as a wheel or mechanism) in a system.
          <br /><br />
          Gear ratio is a very important parameter that determines the Applications of the gears, Output speed, Number of Teeth in individual gears.
        </p><br />
          <div class="listp">
              <ul>
                <li>
                  When you have a system with a Driving Gear that is SMALLER than the Driven Gear you will increase Torque and decrease Speed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When you have a system with a Driving Gear that is LARGER than the Driven Gear you will increase Speed and decrease Torque
                </li>
              </ul>
          </div>

          </p>


        <p class="step">Backlash</p>
        <p>
          Backlash, a clearance between mating gear teeth, is built into speed reducers to let the gears mesh without binding and to provide space for a film of lubricating oil between the teeth. This prevents overheating and tooth damage.
        </p>
        <p class="step">Diametral Pitch</p>
        <p>
          It is defined as the number of teeth per inch of the diameter of the pitch circle of gear.
        </p>

          <h1> Gear Design in AutoCAD</h1>
          <p>
          I started designing gears in AutoCAD, since I was going to use <a><b>3rd party software</b></a>to design the gears I was just focusing on the <a><b>pitch diameter</b></a> only.<br /><br />
            I want to make parametric relations between the circles because I was intended to make one prototype first.
          </p>
          <p class="step">
            Pitch circles of planetary gear
          </p>
          <p>
          I started with pitch circles because it makes it easy to predict mesh between the gears.

            Multi-ring gear
          </p>
          <p>
            I wanted to try this concept, I was not sure working of it, but I created one sketch anyway.
  For making these types of designs you should have knowledge of <a><b>Constrains</b></a> and <a

            Paramtric relation
          </p>
          <p>
            <a><b>The reason</b></a>  I want to design in parametric is, I can do much faster iterations on my design, I was working with it first time and I know <a><b>In prototyping</b></a> I will have some kerfing problems. I was also not sure about dimensional tolerance in CNC in the real model, I thought it will take many experiments.
<br /><br />
          I set dimensions of the pitch circle the way it will give <a><b>gear reduction</b></a> of 3, in which the output shaft will rotate one-third of the input shaft.
<br /><br />
            <a><b>Image below</b></a> describes the Gear ratio/ gear reduction relations between the radius of sun gear (s) and the Ring gear (r). Here I am repeatedly talking about gear reduction because Planetary gear is known to reduce the output shaft speed to increase the torque in drive applications in a compact size, we can also increase the speed to third by taking input as a ring here.

            Parameters

          <p>
            This picture shows the parametric relation between gears and ring, my main parameter here is <a><b>Sun gear Diameter</b></a>.
          </p>
          <p>
           Here I kept sun gear Diameter <a><b>60 mm</b></a> for the prototype. It changes the planet and ring gear diameter accordingly. <a><b>a</b></a> is the Diameter for Shafts or Wooden dowels (On Axle).

          <p>
            After Finalizing my parameters I have to design the cad model for the proper way of understanding in joining and frame of Gear assembly. Since it was a critical and time-consuming part to make my own teeth design I decided to take the help of software or plugins.

            So, I used to plug in for the fusion360 "<a https://apps.autodesk.com/FUSION/en/Detail/Index?id=6294804001663532834&appLang=en&os=Win64> <b>FM gears</b></a>" for generating gears. To run the script go to the "<a><b>Add-ins and script</b></a>" infusion 360 and ad FM gears, Then open the FM gears from <a><b>create menu</b></a>.

            Parameters
          </p>
          <p>
            These are the parameter You can give on the FM module, Everything else will be controlled by the inter-relations of parameters then. I kept the <a><b>Unit</b></a> system to standard <a><b>Metric</b></a> because I am not familiar with the English parameter.

            <br /><br /><a><b>Pressure angle: </b></a> I kept the pressure angle <a><b>20 degree</b></a> here. there are three standard pressure angles <a><b>14.5</b></a>, <a><b>20</b></a>.<a><b>25</b></a>.
<pre>
<code>
Pressure angle: Pressure angle in relation to gear teeth, also known as the angle of obliquity, is the angle between the tooth face and the gear wheel tangent. It is more precisely the angle at a pitch point between the line of pressure (which is normal to the tooth surface) and the plane tangent to the pitch surface. The pressure angle gives the direction normal to the tooth profile.

<a>Lower the pressure angle higher will be power transmission( in terms of pressure angle). But higher pressure angle will give good loading ability(Torque) and increase the stress as well.</a>
</code>
</pre>
          <p>
            Since I have an application of torque and I did not want my teeth to break I kept it to 20 degrees.
            <br /><br />
            Here <a><b>module</b></a> will take control of the number of teeth, the higher the module laser the number of teeth. but I should be kept at an optimum value to have smooth power transmission. I kept <a><b>Module: 2</b></a>.

            Finalizing Perfect diameter</p>
          <p>
            I have to make 3 prototype cuts for my design.
          <pre>
<code>
<a>First one</a> : I gave dimensions same as mdf sheet to test. (0.5 mm additional)

<li>Sun gear : 60.5 mm</li>
<li>planet gear : 30.5 mm</li>
<li>Ring gear : 119.5 mm</li>
</code>
</pre>
          I knew it might work because it was design for mdf but I want to know how much it looses. I found it was spacing <a><b>1.5 mm</b></a> on one side.
          for component that I directly added <a><b>1 mm</b></a> in sun and planet and decrease same from ring.<br /><br />
          <pre>
<code>
<a>second one</a> : (1 mm additional)

<li>Sun gear : 61 mm</li>
<li>planet gear : 31 mm</li>
<li>Ring gear : 119 mm</li>
</code>
</pre>
          And it was <a><b>bad idea</b></a>, now <a>Ring gear</a> was small for sun and planet to assemble, I hardly placed planet in assembly but it will surely break if I try to force it in more then few times. so my two models fail. but I found
          one solution though. I <a><b>Checked</b></a> if I took sun and planet of <a><b>version 1</b></a> and ring of <a><b>version 2</b></a> I was giving perfect result. not too tight not too loose.

          <p>
            It worked , I was marking every version so did not get confuse on them. <a><b>Then</b></a> I made three sets of dimensions of last one to glue them and made one frame to support ring gear.

            screws in betwee the sheets. but main problem is screws can be in way of our toolpath and we never know exatly how far it is from main tool path , I saw some screws are cut from tool so far.<br /><br />

            So solution I came with is use <a><b>Pockets</b></a>. I was going to cut Pockets in sheet of <a><b>1 or 2 mm</b></a> and place the screws there. so I can have perfect location where can I put the screws and main avantage is if I have to
            change the location of profile I will know where to put new profile exatly.

          <h3>Partworks</h3>


          <p>
            partworks is software solution for the cutting and creating different shapes in <a><b>CNC</b></a>. Partworks can help to generate <a><b>3d patterns with profiles</b></a>, <a><b>Pockets</b></a>, <a><b>Drills</b></a>. with <a><b>partworks
                3D</b></a> user can able to do <a><b>2.5D</b></a> cut or <a><b>3D milling</b></a>. <br /><br />

            <a>There is a small issue between our CNC and partworks software , they have different orientation. axis orientation differ by <a><b>90 degree anticlock wise</b></a></a><br /><br />
            in Our CNC
            <li>
              X axis - <a><b>Width</b></a> : 1200 mm
            </li>
            <li>
              Y axis - <a><b>Length</b></a> : 2400 mm
            </li><br /><br />
            But since axis orientation is different in CNC and the partworks I have to interchange the values of <a><b>Width</b></a> and <a><b>Length</b></a> because they are differ by <a><b>90 degrees anticlock</b></a>.<br /><br />
            In Partworks

            <li>
              X axis - <a><b>Lenth</b></a> : 2400 mm
            </li>
            <li>
              Y axis - <a><b>Width</b></a>: 1200 mm

            <li>
              Material thickness : 12 mm
            </li>
            <li>

            <a><b>Using buiscuit type joinery</b></a> : it would be good if I could use Buiscuit type joinery and I intended to do that , but two frames should be concentric for that if not they will misalign and I will not able to fit my planetry

            <a><b>Use of nails :</b></a> for my case it was solution , I could realign if theres a some error in misalignment, it is easy to add and remove also. ao I choose nails

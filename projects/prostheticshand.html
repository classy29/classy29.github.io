          This Project is part of my University final project which was to make 3d printed, easy to customize prosthetic hand. Our focus was on the building of low-cost prosthetic hand which can be affordable to handicapped people and easy to
          operate. Our first aim was to build the 3d printed prosthetic mechanical operated hand which can able to grab things such as water bottles, Mobile, and tools used in his day to day life.

        <h2>First section</h2>
        <h1>concept design</h1>
        <p>
          I started making concept design. at first, I thought of the <a href="https://www.assh.org/handcare/condition/extensor-tendon-injury#:~:text=Extensor%20tendons%20are%20just%20under,from%20their%20attachment%20to%20bone"
            target="_blank"><b>extenson tendon</b></a> and <a href="https://tria.com/condition/flexor-tendon-injuries/#:~:text=In%20the%20hand%2C%20the%20flexor,tendon%20to%20bend%20the%20tip" target="_blank"><b>Flexor tendon</b></a> mechanism as we
          humans have.
          <br /><br />
          Tendons are the soft tissue that connects our muscles to the bone allowing them to be a pully and subsequently produce movement. Tendons differ from muscles because they are mainly made up of collagen and elastin; this means they cannot
          contract themselves, but they are incredibly strong and stiff. They also have a much smaller blood supply, reducing their metabolism.
          <bR /><br />
          Their stiffness means tendons have a remarkable ability to store and release energy like a spring. So much that the Achilles tendon can be responsible for 55-60% of your force production when running!</p>

          my Extensor and Flexor :)
        </p>
        <p>I chose 0.3 mm copper wires as Extensor tendon which will move fingers by servo and elastic rubber bands as flexor tendon. i made some small slots in finger modules to place rubber. initially i thought this will save my time to make extra
          holles for elastic bands and desgin will be more simple. <a><b>But</b></a>, idea of rubber band was not physically possible in this design. so i made some modifications in designs and instead of rubber band i used elastic strings which will
          do the same theoritically.</p>

        <p class="step">
          Fibonacci Sequence
        </p>
        <p>
          The Fibonacci sequence is named after Leonardo Fibonacci, an Italian mathematician who wrote about the pattern in his journals as he observed how rabbits reproduce.<br /><br />
          The Fibonacci sequence works like this. Let’s say you have two segments of a specific length, A and B, where A is bigger than B. If these two segments are in a Fibonacci sequence, the bigger piece divided by the smaller piece will be
          approximately 1.618.
        </p>
        <img src="images\prostheticshand\concept_stage\4.jpg" alt="">
        <img src="images\prostheticshand\concept_stage\5.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="step">
          golden ration
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, if you take A’s length and add it to B’s length, then divide by A’s length, you will get the same number: 1.618. This ratio is called the golden ratio.<br /><br />
          For example, the following numbers are a Fibonacci sequence: 3, 5, 8,13, 21, 34, 55, etc. When we divide 5 by 3 we get about 1.6. Divide 8 by 5 you also get about 1.6. 13 divided by 8? About 1.6 again!<br /><br />
          The ratio of the bigger number divided by the smaller number, that always equals 1.6, is denoted by the Greek letter Phi (Φ) and is called the Golden Ratio. You can find Phi in the above Fibonacci example: 13 / 8 = 1.615.
        </p>

        <p class="step">
          Fibonacci sequence in Human hand
        </p>
        <p>
          Look at your hand. Each of your fingers has three bones in it called phalanges (phalanx for singular). When you measure the length of the phalanges in order from the wrist to the tip of each finger, you will find that the sequence of
          lengths is pretty close to a Fibonacci sequence.
        </p>

          Parametric relations of Finger
        </p>
        <p>
          Now i know the mathematical relations between different phalanx in fingers. i can make proper finger which can grip the object naturally. without any complex design implementation.

        <p class="step">
          Palm design
        </p>
        <p>
          Palm design was much harder to make because i was not able to define proper thumb position which is important part of the design.
          <br /><br />
          In human hand, our thumb has two degree of freedom and it can change its positon according to size and length of the object. this level of complexity was hard to achive for me at this level so i gave fix position for thumb.

          3d prints section it will be there.

            <li>
              in palm, right now i cant fit more than one finger, because of spacing of joints in palm. i have to increase the spacing, in drawback this will increase palm size also.
